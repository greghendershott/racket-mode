@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

The @uref{https://www.racket-mode.com/,Racket Mode} package consists of a variety of Emacs major and minor modes, including:

@itemize
@item
@code{racket-mode}: A major mode for editing @code{.rkt} files.

@item
@ref{racket-xp-mode}: An optional minor mode that enhances @code{racket-mode} to explain and explore code.

@item
@code{racket-repl-mode}: A major mode for running programs providing a REPL.

@item
Various other modes to support specific features:
@itemize
@item
@ref{racket-logger-mode}
@item
@ref{racket-profile-mode}
@item
@ref{racket-debug-mode}

@node Install Update and Uninstall
@chapter Install, Update, and Uninstall

The most common way to use Racket Mode is to install from a package archive like MELPA or NonGNU ELPA.

Some people also use a system like @uref{https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el,straight.el}.

Note that Racket Mode is only available on MELPA (@emph{not} ``MELPA Stable''), and is available as a ``rolling release'' from NonGNU ELPA.

@node Use Emacs 281 or newer with NonGNU ELPA
@section Use Emacs 28.1 or newer with NonGNU ELPA

Emacs 28.1 or newer comes configured to use @uref{https://elpa.nongnu.org,NonGNU ELPA}, in which case you can skip ahead to @ref{Install,Install}.

With older versions of Emacs, you can use MELPA.

@node Configure Emacs to use MELPA
@section Configure Emacs to use MELPA

Following is a quick guide that may work for you. (For definitive instructions and the latest trouble-shooting tips, please see @uref{https://melpa.org/#/getting-started}.)

@itemize
@item
Add the following to your @verb{,~/.emacs,} or @verb{,~/.emacs.d/init.el,}:
@end itemize

@lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
              '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
              t)
(package-initialize)
@end lisp

@itemize
@item
Restart Emacs.
@end itemize

@quotation
NOTE: If you ever get an error message about ``contacting a host'' or ``downloading an archive'', the problem is not unique to Racket Mode. Please see @uref{https://melpa.org/#/getting-started}.
@end quotation

@node Install
@section Install

When Emacs is configured to use NonGNU ELPA or MELPA:

@enumerate
@item
Type @kbd{M-x}  @code{package-initialize} @kbd{RET} .

@item
Type @kbd{M-x}  @code{package-refresh-contents} @kbd{RET} .

@item
Type @kbd{M-x}  @code{package-install} @kbd{RET}  @code{racket-mode} @kbd{RET} .
@end enumerate

@quotation
NOTE: If you get an error message about ``contacting a host'' or ``downloading an archive'', the problem is not unique to Racket Mode. Please see @uref{https://melpa.org/#/getting-started}.
@end quotation

@node Minimal Racket
@section Minimal Racket

If you have installed the minimal Racket distribution (for example by using the @uref{https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/minimal-racket.rb,homebrew formula}) Racket Mode needs some additional Racket packages. A simple way to get all these packages is to install the @code{drracket} Racket package. In a command shell:

@example
raco pkg install --auto drracket
@end example

A more-targeted approach is instead to install these specific packages and their dependencies:

@example
raco pkg install --auto data-lib errortrace-lib macro-debugger-text-lib rackunit-lib racket-index scribble-lib drracket-tool-text-lib
@end example

If you do @emph{not} want to use @code{racket-xp-mode}, then you can omit @code{drracket-tool-text-lib}.

On a headless server, you might want to omit @code{gui-lib}. Unfortunately, @code{racket-doc} depends on @code{gui-lib}. On the one hand, if you uninstall @code{racket-doc} and @code{gui-lib}, you will no longer be able to access documentation when using a Racket Mode back end running there. On the other hand, if you leave @code{gui-lib} installed, you should be careful to run the Racket Mode back end using @code{xvfb-run racket}.

@node Uninstall
@section Uninstall

To uninstall Racket Mode, simply type @kbd{M-x}  @code{package-delete} @kbd{RET}  @code{racket-mode} @kbd{RET} .

You should probably also exit and restart Emacs.

@node Update
@section Update

@menu
* Upgrading all packages::
* Updating just Racket Mode::
@end menu

@node Upgrading all packages
@subsection Upgrading all packages

The ``easy path'' provided by Emacs is to update @emph{all} packages to their latest versions. Although you might not want to do this --- see next section --- here is how to do so:

@enumerate
@item
Use @kbd{M-x}  @code{package-initialize}.

@item
Use @kbd{M-x}  @code{package-refresh-contents}.

@item
Use @kbd{M-x}  @code{list-packages}. It should display a message like ``42 packages can be upgraded; type ‘U’ to mark them for upgrading.''.

@item
Press @kbd{U}  as suggested to mark them all.

@item
Press @kbd{x}  to execute.
@end enumerate

After such a mass update, it might be wise to exit and restart Emacs.

@quotation
NOTE: If you get an error message about ``contacting a host'' or ``downloading an archive'', the problem is not unique to Racket Mode. Please see @uref{https://melpa.org/#/getting-started}.
@end quotation

@node Updating just Racket Mode
@subsection Updating just Racket Mode

Updating all packages sometimes is more than you want. For example, maybe you will discover that some packages have changed in ways that require you to take time to learn about, change customizations, and so on.

To update just Racket Mode:

@enumerate
@item
@ref{Uninstall}.

@item
Optional but most reliable: Exit and restart Emacs.

@item
@ref{Install} again. This will install the latest version.
@end enumerate

@node Configure
@chapter Configure

Although Racket Mode can be customized with many @ref{Variables}, there is only one that you might @emph{need} to set: @ref{racket-program}. This is the name or pathname of the Racket executable. It defaults to @code{Racket.exe} on Windows else @code{racket}.

On Windows or Linux, this default will probably work for you.

On macOS, downloading Racket doesn't add its @code{bin} directory to your @code{PATH}. Even after you add it, GUI Emacs doesn't automatically use your path (unless you use the handy @uref{https://melpa.org/#/exec-path-from-shell,exec-path-from-shell} package). Therefore you might want to set @code{racket-program} to a complete pathname.

You can @code{setq} this directly in your Emacs init file (@verb{,~/.emacs,} or @verb{,~/.emacs.d/init.el,}), or, use @kbd{M-x}  @code{customize}, as you prefer.

@node Key bindings
@section Key bindings

To customize things like key bindings, you can use @code{racket-mode-hook} in your Emacs init file to modify @code{racket-mode-map}. For example, although @kbd{C-c C-c}  is bound by default to the @code{racket-run} command, let's say you wanted @kbd{F5}  to be an additional binding:

@lisp
(add-hook 'racket-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (define-key racket-mode-map (kbd "<f5>") 'racket-run)))
@end lisp

Likewise for @code{racket-repl-mode-hook} and @code{racket-repl-mode-map}.

@node Font-lock (syntax highlighting)
@section Font-lock (syntax highlighting)

Font-lock (as Emacs calls syntax highlighting) can be controlled using the variable @code{font-lock-maximum-decoration}, which defaults to @code{t} (maximum). You can set it to a number, where @code{0} is the lowest level. You can even supply an association list to specify different values for different major modes.

Historically you might choose a lower level for speed. These days you might do so because you prefer a simpler appearance.

Racket Mode supports four, increasing levels of font-lock:

@itemize
@item
@code{0}: Just strings, comments, and @code{#lang}.
@item
@code{1}: @code{#:keyword} and self-evaluating literals like numbers, quoted symbols (including symbols with spaces delimited by @code{|} characters), and @code{#rx} and @code{#px} regular expressions.
@item
@code{2}: Identifiers in @code{define}-like and @code{let}-like forms.
@item
@code{3}: Identifiers provided by @code{racket}, @code{typed/racket}, @code{racket/syntax}, and @code{syntax/parse}. (This level effectively treats Racket as a language, instead of a language for making languages.).
@end itemize

@node Completion at point
@section Completion at point

In Emacs, a major mode may supply a ``completion-at-point function''. This function is used by manual completion commands like @code{complete-symbol} (bound by default to @kbd{C-M-i} ), as well as by auto-completion packages like @code{company-mode}.

@itemize
@item
@code{racket-mode} supplies @code{racket-complete-at-point}, which simply supplies the same symbols that it knows how to font-lock. This does @emph{not} require the Racket Mode back end to be running. But of course the completion candidates do not correspond to your program's definitions or those it imports. This is a static, ``better than nothing'' fallback.

@item
@code{racket-xp-mode} --- an optional minor mode that enhances @code{racket-mode} --- supplies @code{racket-xp-complete-at-point}, which uses a static analysis to find local and imported binding names. Although this requires the Racket Mode back end to be running --- and will automatically start it --- it does @emph{not} require the edit buffer to be @code{racket-run}. This also supplies meta data usable by the @code{company-capf} backend.

@item
@code{racket-repl-mode} supplies @code{racket-repl-complete-at-point}, which uses the result of @code{namespace-mapped-symbols} on the program currently running in the REPL.
@end itemize

These completion functions are set by default. (However, @code{racket-xp-mode} is not enabled by default. To do so: @ref{racket-xp-mode}.)

If you want @kbd{TAB}  to do completion as well as indent, add the following to your Emacs init file:

@lisp
(setq tab-always-indent 'complete)
@end lisp

This changes the behavior of Emacs' standard @code{indent-for-tab-command}, to which @kbd{TAB}  is bound by default in @code{racket-mode} and @code{racket-repl-mode}.

@node Completion in minibuffer
@section Completion in minibuffer

Sometimes Racket Mode asks for input in the minibuffer. To do so it uses the standard Emacs function @code{completing-read}, so as to be compatible with all Emacs packages that enhance @code{completing-read}, such as helm, ivy, ido-completing-read+, vertico, and so on.

(Earlier versions of Racket Mode sometimes used @code{ido-completing-read}. If you have upgraded Racket Mode and miss that, simply install the ido-completing-read+ package.)

@node Xref (definitions and references)
@section Xref (definitions and references)

Several modes support the Emacs commands

@itemize
@item
@kbd{M-.}  @code{xref-find-definitions}
@item
@kbd{M-?}  @code{xref-find-references}
@item
@kbd{M-,}  @code{xref-pop-marker-stack}
@end itemize

To do so, each mode adds a local hook for @code{xref-backend-functions}:

@itemize
@item
@ref{racket-mode}: @code{#'racket-mode-xref-backend-function}
@item
@ref{racket-xp-mode}: @code{#'racket-xp-xref-backend-function}
@item
@ref{racket-repl-mode}: @code{#'racket-repl-xref-backend-function}
@end itemize

If you prefer, you can remove the local hook --- e.g. for @code{racket-mode}: @code{(remove-hook 'xref-backend-functions #'racket-mode-xref-function t)}.

You can @code{M-x customize-group} and enter @code{xref} to adjust some other settings. For example, the customization variable @code{xref-prompt-for-identifier} controls which commands prompt you and when. You might prefer to set it to @code{nil}.

If you use @code{paredit}, by default it binds @kbd{M-?}  to @code{paredit-convolute-sexp}. You can change that binding in @code{paredit-mode-map} allowing the global binding for @kbd{M-?}  to be used, or, pick some other key for @code{xref-find-references} in the global map.

Finally, what to expect:

@itemize
@item
Racket does not have a global or project-wide database of definitions and references.
@item
Various modules can export identifiers with the same symbolic value -- for example a different ``define'' is provided by @code{racket/base}, @code{typed/racket/base}, and other modules.
@item
A module can import something, then rename, contract, and re-export it.
@end itemize

As a result, to find a definition, it is necessary to know exactly @emph{which} identifier is meant --- either by expanding the module (as is done by @code{racket-xp-mode}) or by actually running it (@code{racket-repl-mode}). Once known, we can usually find the definition site, even through a chain of renaming and/or contract-wrapping exports. In addition, when point is on a module within  @code{require} form, we can usually find the source file. (In plain @code{racket-mode} edit buffers not enhanced by @code{racket-xp-mode}, the only thing that @code{xref-find-definitions} does is visit relative requires, e.g. @code{foo.rkt} in @code{(require "foo.rkt")}.)

As for finding references, the default xref implementation is used, which greps for strings among a project's files. Although @code{racket-xp-mode} can sometimes do better, using @code{drracket/check-syntax} for definitions and references @emph{within} the current buffer, beyond those it also falls back to the default implementation.

In any case, using the Emacs xref API allows for consistent command names, shortcut keys, and even a special buffer to navigate among references and visit each source location.

@node Indent
@section Indent

Indentation can be customized in a way similar to lisp-mode and scheme-mode: @ref{racket-indent-line}.

(Indentation preserves your line breaks. If you want to use an auto-reformatter --- an expressive pretty printer that chooses line breaks while computing an optimal layout --- the Racket package @uref{https://docs.racket-lang.org/fmt/,fmt} is supported by the Emacs package @uref{https://github.com/lassik/emacs-format-all-the-code,emacs-format-all-the-code}.)

@node paredit
@section paredit

If you use @uref{https://melpa.org/#/paredit,paredit}, you might want to add keybindings to @code{paredit-mode-map}:

@itemize
@item
Bind the curly brace keys to @code{paredit-open-curly} and @code{paredit-close-curly}.

@item
Bind whatever keys you prefer for @code{paredit-wrap-square} and @code{paredit-wrap-curly}.
@end itemize

For example, with @uref{https://melpa.org/#/use-package,@code{use-package}}:

@lisp
(use-package paredit
  :ensure t
  :config
  (dolist (m '(emacs-lisp-mode-hook
               racket-mode-hook
               racket-repl-mode-hook))
    (add-hook m #'paredit-mode))
  (bind-keys :map paredit-mode-map
             ("@{"   . paredit-open-curly)
             ("@}"   . paredit-close-curly))
  (unless terminal-frame
    (bind-keys :map paredit-mode-map
               ("M-[" . paredit-wrap-square)
               ("M-@{" . paredit-wrap-curly))))
@end lisp

Starting c. November 2022, paredit binds the @kbd{RET}  key to its own command. Unfortunately this is @emph{not} compatible with interactive modes --- including but not limited to @code{racket-repl-mode} --- which expect @kbd{RET}  to be bound to a command to submit your input to the REPL. In other words, if you type an expression and hit @kbd{RET} , nothing will happen and the REPL will seem frozen. You @code{M-x racket-repl-submit} to proceed.

If you want to use paredit with interactive modes, their advice is to remove the binding from @code{paredit-mode-map} (note that this will also disable it for all buffers, including editing buffers). One way you can do this for all related keys:

@lisp
(dolist (k '("RET" "C-m" "C-j"))
  (define-key paredit-mode-map (kbd k) nil))
@end lisp

@node smartparens
@section smartparens

If instead of paredit you prefer @uref{https://melpa.org/#/smartparens,smartparens}, you can use the default configuration it provides for Lisp modes generally and for Racket Mode specifically:

@lisp
(require 'smartparens-config)
@end lisp

@node Appearance of parentheses
@section Appearance of parentheses

If you prefer parentheses to appear ``dimmed'', see @uref{https://melpa.org/#/paren-face,paren-face}.

If you prefer the opposite, see @uref{https://melpa.org/#/rainbow-delimiters,rainbow-delimiters}.

@node Edit buffers and REPL buffers
@section Edit buffers and REPL buffers

By default, all @code{racket-mode} edit buffers share one @code{racket-repl-mode} buffer, named @code{*Racket REPL*}. For example, if you run foo.rkt, the REPL prompt changes to @code{foo.rkt>}, and the REPL is inside the file module namespace. If you then run bar.rkt, the REPL prompt changes to @code{bar.rkt>}, and you are in that namespace.

If you prefer, you can use more than one REPL buffer, by customizing the variable @ref{racket-repl-buffer-name-function}:

@itemize
@item
Share a REPL buffer among files belonging to the same project; each REPL buffer is named @code{*Racket REPL <project-name>*}.
@item
A unique REPL buffer for each edit buffer, similar to Dr Racket; each REPL buffer is named @code{*Racket REPL <file.rkt>*}.
@item
You can also define your own, custom function.
@end itemize

You can customize where the REPL buffer is displayed by adding an item to the Emacs variable @code{display-buffer-alist}. A good regular expression to use for this would be @code{\\`\\*Racket REPL}. For example, if you wanted to make the REPL buffer appear in a new frame:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist
             '("\\`\\*Racket REPL"
               (display-buffer-reuse-window
                display-buffer-pop-up-frame)
               (reusable-frames . 0)
               (inhibit-same-window . t)))
@end lisp

@node eldoc
@section eldoc

By default Racket Mode sets @code{eldoc-documentation-function} to @code{nil} --- no @code{eldoc-mode} support. You may set it to @code{racket-eldoc-function} in a @code{racket-mode-hook} and @code{racket-repl-mode-hook} if you really want to use @code{eldoc-mode} with Racket. But it is not a very satisfying experience because Racket is not a very ``eldoc-friendly'' language. Although Racket Mode attempts to discover argument lists, contracts, or types this doesn't work in many common cases:

@itemize
@item
Many Racket primitives are defined in @code{#%kernel} or @code{#%runtime}. There's no easy way to determine their argument lists. Most do not @code{provide} a contract.

@item
Many of the interesting Racket forms are syntax (macros) not functions. There's no easy way to determine their ``argument lists''.

@item
When a form has documentation, Racket Mode can show the \"bluebox\'' -- but often that does not fit in a single line as you would normally expect with eldoc.
@end itemize

A more satisfying experience is to use @ref{racket-xp-describe} or @ref{racket-xp-documentation}.

@node Unicode input method
@section Unicode input method

An optional Emacs input method, @code{racket-unicode}, lets you easily type various Unicode symbols that might be useful when writing Racket code.

To automatically enable the @code{racket-unicode} input method in @code{racket-mode} and @code{racket-repl-mode} buffers, put the following code in your Emacs init file:

@lisp
(add-hook 'racket-mode-hook      #'racket-unicode-input-method-enable)
(add-hook 'racket-repl-mode-hook #'racket-unicode-input-method-enable)
@end lisp

@xref{racket-unicode-input-method-enable}.

@node Ligatures
@section Ligatures

Prior to Emacs 28.0.50, things like @code{auto-composition-mode} or @code{ligature-mode} that use @code{composition-function-table} to display ligatures can cause Emacs to freeze. This can happen when an Emacs @emph{overlay} displays a string containing such a ligature. Although the problem is not limited to Racket Mode, it affects the overlays created by @code{racket-show-pseudo-tooltip}, as used by @code{racket-xp-mode}. The only known work-around is to change the value of @code{racket-show-functions} to something ``boring'' such as @code{(racket-show-echo-area)}.

@node Architecture
@chapter Architecture

Racket Mode consists of a single Emacs front end, and one or more processes running a back end written in Racket.@footnote{Racket Mode's Racket code is delivered as part of the Emacs package --- @emph{not} as a Racket package. Delivering both Emacs and Racket code in one Emacs package simplifies installation and updates. The main drawback is that the Racket code is not automatically compiled, as would normally be done by @code{raco pkg install}. To address this: @xref{racket-mode-start-faster}.}

A back end is responsible for commands that cannot be implemented in Emacs Lisp, as well as supplying zero or more REPLs.

Although you can start and stop a back end with @code{racket-start-back-end} and @code{racket-stop-back-end}, a back end is normally started automatically when the front end needs to issue some command. This includes commands that do @emph{not} involve @code{racket-run} or a REPL. For example @code{racket-xp-mode} issues commands to check your code and annotate the buffer, even if you do not run it. In other words, a back end supplies zero or more REPLs --- a back end is not the same thing as a REPL.

To learn more about how @emph{many} REPLs are used: @xref{racket-repl-buffer-name-function}.

In the common case there is only one back end, on the same local host as Emacs, and it is used for @code{.rkt} files in any directory.

@image{scenario-0,,, Emacs front end and one local back end. Command I/O via pipe (local) or ssh (remote). REPL I/O via one TCP connection per REPL buffer (local/remote). Each back end provides zero or more REPLs.,.svg}

However you can configure using any number of back ends on any number of local or remote hosts.

As one example, you can have multiple back ends on the local host. One back end is used for a project under a specific subdirectory, and the other back end for all others. (Perhaps one project needs Racket built from source, and everything else uses an installed, older version of Racket. By using different back ends, not only will @code{racket-run} use the desired version of Racket for a file, so will commands for documentation or visiting definitions.)

@image{scenario-1,,, Emacs front end and two local back ends --- one for a project path. Command I/O via pipe (local) or ssh (remote). REPL I/O via one TCP connection per REPL buffer (local/remote). Each back end provides zero or more REPLs.,.svg}

Furthermore, you could work with a project located on a remote host, whose files you edit using TRAMP. You also want the back end to run there. For a remote host, Racket Mode copies its back end source files to the remote when necessary, and runs the back end using ssh.

@image{scenario-2,,, Emacs front end and a back end on a remote host. Command I/O via pipe (local) or ssh (remote). REPL I/O via one TCP connection per REPL buffer (local/remote). Each back end provides zero or more REPLs.,.svg}

Of course the remote can also use different back ends for different paths.

@image{scenario-3,,, Emacs front end and two back ends on a remote host. Command I/O via pipe (local) or ssh (remote). REPL I/O via one TCP connection per REPL buffer (local/remote). Each back end provides zero or more REPLs.,.svg}

And of course you can have multiple remotes.

@image{scenario-4,,, Emacs front end and two back ends each on two remote hosts. Command I/O via pipe (local) or ssh (remote). REPL I/O via one TCP connection per REPL buffer (local/remote). Each back end provides zero or more REPLs.,.svg}

If you need any of these ``fancy'' configurations: @xref{racket-add-back-end}.

However by default a configuration is automatically created for one back end on the local host. For that very common case, you don't need to configure anything.

In addition to any hooks its parent mode @code{prog-mode} might have run,

during initialization.

@node racket-insert-lambda
@subsection racket-insert-lambda

@kbd{C-M-y} 

Insert λ.

To insert Unicode symbols generally, see @ref{racket-unicode-input-method-enable}.

@node racket-fold-all-tests
@subsection racket-fold-all-tests

@kbd{C-c C-f} 

Fold (hide) all test submodules.

@node racket-unfold-all-tests
@subsection racket-unfold-all-tests

@kbd{C-c C-u} 

Unfold (show) all test submodules.

@node racket-tidy-requires
@subsection racket-tidy-requires

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-tidy-requires}

Make a single ``require'' form, modules sorted, one per line.

The scope of this command is the innermost module around point,
including the outermost module for a file using a ``#lang'' line.
All require forms within that module are combined into a single
form. Within that form:

@itemize
@item
A single subform is used for each phase level, sorted in this
order: for-syntax, for-template, for-label, for-meta, and
plain (phase 0).

@itemize
@item
Within each level subform, the modules are sorted:

@itemize
@item
Collection path modules -- sorted alphabetically.

@item
Subforms such as only-in.

@item
Quoted relative requires -- sorted alphabetically.
@end itemize
@end itemize
@end itemize

At most one required module is listed per line.

See also: @ref{racket-trim-requires} and @ref{racket-base-requires}.

@node racket-trim-requires
@subsection racket-trim-requires

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-trim-requires}

Like @ref{racket-tidy-requires} but also deletes unnecessary requires.

Note: This only works when the source file can be fully expanded
with no errors.

Note: This only works for requires at the top level of a source
file using #lang. It does NOT work for require forms inside
module forms. Furthermore, it is not smart about module+ or
module* forms -- it might delete top level requires that are
actually needed by such submodules.

See also: @ref{racket-base-requires}.

@node racket-base-requires
@subsection racket-base-requires

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-base-requires}

Change from ``#lang racket'' to ``#lang racket/base''.

Adds explicit requires for imports that are provided by
``racket'' but not by ``racket/base''.

This is a recommended optimization for Racket applications.
Avoiding loading all of ``racket'' can reduce load time and
memory footprint.

Also, as does @ref{racket-trim-requires}, this removes unneeded
modules and tidies everything into a single, sorted require form.

Note: This only works when the source file can be fully expanded
with no errors.

Note: This only works for requires at the top level of a source
file using #lang. It does NOT work for require forms inside
module forms. Furthermore, it is not smart about module+ or
module* forms -- it might delete top level requires that are
actually needed by such submodules.

Note: Currently this only helps change ``#lang racket'' to
``#lang racket/base''. It does not help with other similar
conversions, such as changing ``#lang typed/racket'' to ``#lang
typed/racket/base''.

@node racket-add-require-for-identifier
@subsection racket-add-require-for-identifier

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-add-require-for-identifier}

Add a require for the identifier at point.

When more than one module supplies an identifer with the same
name, they are listed for you to choose one. The list is sorted
alphabetically, except modules starting with ``racket/'' and
``typed/racket/'' are sorted before others.

A ``require'' form is inserted into the buffer, followed by doing
a @ref{racket-tidy-requires}.

Caveat: This works in terms of identifiers that are documented.
The mechanism is similar to that used for Racket's ``Search
Manuals'' feature. Today there exists no system-wide database of
identifiers that are exported but not documented.

@node racket-indent-line
@subsection racket-indent-line

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-indent-line}

Indent current line as Racket code.

Normally you don't invoke this command directly. Instead, because
it is used as the value for the variable @code{indent-line-function}
in @ref{racket-mode} and @ref{racket-repl-mode} buffers, it is used
automatically when you press keys like RET or TAB. However you
might refer to it when configuring custom indentation, explained
below.

Following the tradition of @code{lisp-mode} and @code{scheme-mode}, the
primary way to determine the indentation of a form is to look for
a rule stored as a @code{racket-indent-function} property.

To extend, use your Emacs init file to

@lisp
    (put SYMBOL 'racket-indent-function INDENT)
@end lisp

SYMBOL is the name of the Racket form like ``test-case'' and
INDENT is an integer or the symbol ``defun''. When INDENT is an
integer, the meaning is the same as for lisp-indent-function and
scheme-indent-function: Indent the first INDENT arguments
specially and indent any further arguments like a body. (The
number may be negative; see discussion below.)

For example:

@lisp
    (put 'test-case 'racket-indent-function 1)
@end lisp

This will change the indent of @code{test-case} from this:

@example
    (test-case foo
               blah
               blah)
@end example

to this:

@example
    (test-case foo
      blah
      blah)
@end example

For backward compatibility, if @code{racket-indent-function} has no
property for a symbol, a scheme-indent-function property is also
considered, although the ``with-'' indents defined by scheme-mode
are ignored. This is only to help people who may have extensive
scheme-indent-function settings, particularly in the form of file
or dir local variables. Otherwise prefer putting properties on
@code{racket-indent-function}.

If no explicit rules match, regular expressions are used for a
couple special cases:

@itemize
@item
Forms that start with ``begin'' indent like ``begin''.

@item
Forms that start with ``def'' or ``with-'' indent like
``define''.
@end itemize

On the one hand this is convenient when you create your own
``DRY'' macros; they will indent as expected without you needing
to make custom indent rules. On the other hand there can be false
matches; for example a function or form named ``defer'' will
indent like ``define''. This is a known drawback and is unlikely
to be fixed unless/until Racket macros someday support a protocol
to communicate how they should be indented.

There is also automatic handling for:

@itemize
@item
Forms that begin with a #:keyword (as found in contracts)

@item
Literal forms like #hasheq()

@item
Quoted forms when the variable @ref{racket-indent-sequence-depth}
  is > 0.

@item
@{@} forms when the variable @ref{racket-indent-curly-as-sequence} is
not nil.
@end itemize

Finally and otherwise, a form will be indented as if it were a
procedure application.

--- --- ---

Note: Racket Mode extends the traditional Emacs lisp indent spec
to allow a @emph{negative} integer, which means that all distinguished
forms should align with the first one. This style originated with
``for/fold'', which has two distinguished forms. Traditionally
those would indent like this:

@example
    (for/fold ([x xs])
        ([y ys])            ; twice body indent
      body)
@end example

However the popularly desired indent is:

@example
    (for/fold ([x xs])
              ([y ys])      ; same as first distingushed form
      body)
@end example

This idea extends to optional distinguished forms, such as Typed
Racket annotation ``prefixes'' in ``for/fold'', ``for/x'', and
even ``let'' forms:

@example
    (for/fold : Type
              ([x xs])
              ([y ys])      ; same as first distingushed form
      body)
@end example

@node racket-smart-open-bracket-mode
@subsection racket-smart-open-bracket-mode

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-smart-open-bracket-mode}

Minor mode to let you always type @code{[}' to insert @code{(} or @code{[} automatically.

Behaves like the ``Automatically adjust opening square brackets''
feature in Dr. Racket.

By default, inserts a @code{(}. Inserts a @code{[} in the following cases:

@itemize
@item
@code{let}-like bindings -- forms with @code{let} in the name as well
as things like @code{parameterize}, @code{with-handlers}, and
@code{with-syntax}.

@item
@code{case}, @code{cond}, @code{match}, @code{syntax-case}, @code{syntax-parse}, and
@code{syntax-rules} clauses.

@item
@code{for}-like bindings and @code{for/fold} accumulators.

@item
@code{class} declaration syntax, such as @code{init} and @code{inherit}.
@end itemize

When the previous s-expression in a sequence is a compound
expression, uses the same kind of delimiter.

To force insert @code{[}, use @code{quoted-insert}.

Combined with @ref{racket-insert-closing} this means that you can
press the unshifted @code{[} and @code{]} keys to get whatever delimiters
follow the Racket conventions for these forms. When something
like @code{electric-pair-mode} or @code{paredit-mode} is active, you need
not even press @code{]}.

Tip: When also using @code{paredit-mode}, enable that first so that
the binding for the @code{[}' key in the map for
@ref{racket-smart-open-bracket-mode} has higher priority. See also
the variable @code{minor-mode-map-alist}.

@node racket-insert-closing
@subsection racket-insert-closing

@kbd{]}  or @kbd{)} 

Insert a matching closing delimiter.

With @kbd{C-u}  insert the typed character as-is.

This is handy if you're not yet using something like
@code{paredit-mode}, @code{smartparens-mode}, @code{parinfer-mode}, or simply
@code{electric-pair-mode} added in Emacs 24.5.

@node racket-cycle-paren-shapes
@subsection racket-cycle-paren-shapes

@kbd{C-c C-p} 

Cycle the sexpr among () [] @{@}.

@node racket-backward-up-list
@subsection racket-backward-up-list

@kbd{C-M-u} 

Like @code{backward-up-list} but works when point is in a string or comment.

Typically you should not use this command in Emacs Lisp --
especially not repeatedly. Instead, initially use
@code{racket--escape-string-or-comment} to move to the start of a
string or comment, if any, then use normal @code{backward-up-list}
repeatedly.

@node racket-unicode-input-method-enable
@subsection racket-unicode-input-method-enable

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-unicode-input-method-enable}

Set input method to racket-unicode.

The racket-unicode input method lets you easily type various
Unicode symbols that might be useful when writing Racket code.

To automatically enable the racket-unicode input method in
racket-mode and racket-repl-mode buffers, put the following code
in your Emacs init file:

@lisp
    (add-hook 'racket-mode-hook #'racket-unicode-input-method-enable)
    (add-hook 'racket-repl-mode-hook #'racket-unicode-input-method-enable)
@end lisp

To temporarily enable this input method for a single buffer you
can use ``M-x racket-unicode-input-method-enable''.

Use the standard Emacs key C-\ to toggle the input method.

When the racket-unicode input method is active, you can for
example type ``All'' and it is immediately replaced with ``∀''. A
few other examples:

@multitable {aaaaaaaaa} {aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa}
@item omega
@tab ω
@item x@math{_1}
@tab x₁
@item x@math{^1}
@tab x¹
@item A
@tab 𝔸
@item test-->>E
@tab test-->>∃ (racket/redex)
@item vdash
@tab ⊢
@end multitable

To see a table of all key sequences use ``M-x
describe-input-method <RET> racket-unicode''.

If you want to add your own mappings to the ``racket-unicode''
input method, you may add code like the following example in your
Emacs init file:

@lisp
    ;; Either (require 'racket-mode) here, or, if you use
    ;; use-package, put the code below in the :config section.
    (with-temp-buffer
      (racket-unicode-input-method-enable)
      (set-input-method "racket-unicode")
      (let ((quail-current-package (assoc "racket-unicode"
                                          quail-package-alist)))
        (quail-define-rules ((append . t))
                            ("^o" ["ᵒ"]))))
@end lisp

If you don’t like the highlighting of partially matching tokens you
can turn it off by setting @code{input-method-highlight-flag} to nil.

@node racket-align
@subsection racket-align

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-align}

Align values in the same column.

Useful for binding forms like ``let'' and ``parameterize'',
conditionals like ``cond'' and ``match'', association lists, and
any series of couples like the arguments to ``hash''.

Before choosing this command, put point on the first of a series
of ``couples''. A couple is:

@itemize
@item
A list of two or more sexprs: "[sexpr val sexpr @dots{}]".
@item
Two sexprs: ``sexpr val''.
@end itemize

Each ``val'' moves to the same column and is
@code{prog-indent-sexp}-ed (in case it is a multi-line form).

For example with point on the "[" before ``a'':

@example
    Before             After

    (let ([a 12]       (let ([a   12]
          [bar 23])          [bar 23])
      ....)              ....)

    ([a . 12]          ([a   . 12]
     [bar . 23])        [bar . 23])

    (cond [a? #t]      (cond [a?   #t]
          [b? (f x           [b?   (f x
                 y)]                  y)]
          [else #f])         [else #f])
@end example

Or with point on the quote before ``a'':

@example
    (list a 12        (list a   12
          bar 23)           bar 23)
@end example

If more than one couple is on the same line, none are aligned,
because it is unclear where the value column should be. For
example the following form will not change; @ref{racket-align} will
display an error message:

@example
    (let ([a 0][b 1]
          [c 2])       error; unchanged
      ....)
@end example

When a couple's sexprs start on different lines, that couple is
ignored. Other, single-line couples in the series are aligned as
usual. For example:

@example
    (let ([foo         (let ([foo
           0]                 0]
          [bar 1]            [bar 1]
          [x 2])             [x   2])
      ....)              ....)
@end example

See also: @ref{racket-unalign}.

@node racket-unalign
@subsection racket-unalign

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-unalign}

The opposite of @ref{racket-align}.

Effectively does M-x @code{just-one-space} and @code{prog-indent-sexp} for
each couple's value.

@node racket-complete-at-point
@subsection racket-complete-at-point

A value for the variable @code{completion-at-point-functions}.

Completion candidates are drawn from the same symbols used for
font-lock. This is a static list. If you want dynamic, smarter
completion candidates, enable the minor mode @ref{racket-xp-mode}.

@node racket-xp-mode
@subsection racket-xp-mode

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-xp-mode}

A minor mode that analyzes expanded code to explain and explore.

This minor mode is an optional enhancement to @ref{racket-mode} edit
buffers. Like any minor mode, you can turn it on or off for a
specific buffer. If you always want to use it, put the following
code in your Emacs init file:

@lisp
    (require 'racket-xp)
    (add-hook 'racket-mode-hook #'racket-xp-mode)
@end lisp

Note: This mode won't do anything unless/until the Racket Mode
back end is running. It will try to start the back end
automatically. You do @emph{not} need to @ref{racket-run} the buffer you
are editing.

This mode uses the drracket/check-syntax package to analyze
fully-expanded programs, without needing to evaluate a.k.a.
``run'' them. The resulting analysis provides information for:

@itemize
@item
Visually annotating bindings -- local or imported definitions
and references to them.

@item
Visually annotating expressions in a tail position, as well as
the enclosing expression with respect to which they are in a
tail position.

@item
Completion candidates.

@item
Defintions' source and documentation.
@end itemize

When point is on a definition or use, related items are
highlighted using @ref{racket-xp-def-face} and @ref{racket-xp-use-face}
-- instead of drawing arrows as in Dr Racket. Information is
displayed using the function(s) in the hook variable
@ref{racket-show-functions}; it is also available when hovering the
mouse cursor.

Note: If you find these point-motion features too distracting
and/or slow, in your @code{racket-xp-mode-hook} you may disable them:

@lisp
  (require 'racket-xp)
  (add-hook 'racket-xp-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (remove-hook 'pre-redisplay-functions
                           #'racket-xp-pre-redisplay
                           t)))
@end lisp

The remaining features discussed below will still work.

You may also use commands to navigate among a definition and its
uses, or to rename a local definitions and all its uses:

@itemize
@item
@ref{racket-xp-next-definition}
@item
@ref{racket-xp-previous-definition}
@item
@ref{racket-xp-next-use}
@item
@ref{racket-xp-previous-use}
@end itemize

In the following little example, not only does
drracket/check-syntax distinguish the various ``x'' bindings, it
understands the two different imports of ``define'':

@example
  #lang racket/base
  (define x 1)
  x
  (let ([x x])
    (+ x 1))
  (module m typed/racket/base
    (define x 2)
    x)
@end example

When point is on the opening parenthesis of an expression in tail
position, it is highlighted using the face
@ref{racket-xp-tail-position-face}.

When point is on the opening parenthesis of an enclosing
expression with respect to which one or more expressions are in
tail position, it is highlighted using the face
@ref{racket-xp-tail-target-face}.

Furthermore, when point is on the opening parenthesis of either
kind of expression, all of the immediately related expressions
are also highlighted. Various commands move among them:

@itemize
@item
@ref{racket-xp-tail-up}
@item
@ref{racket-xp-tail-down}
@item
@ref{racket-xp-tail-next-sibling}
@item
@ref{racket-xp-tail-previous-sibling}
@end itemize

The function @code{racket-xp-complete-at-point} is added to the
variable @code{completion-at-point-functions}. Note that in this case,
it is not smart about submodules; identifiers are assumed to be
definitions from the file's module or its imports. In addition to
supplying completion candidates, it supports the
``:company-location'' property to inspect the definition of a
candidate and the ``:company-doc-buffer'' property to view its
documentation.

When you edit the buffer, existing annotations are retained;
their positions are updated to reflect the edit. Annotations for
new or deleted text are not requested until after
@ref{racket-xp-after-change-refresh-delay} seconds. The request is
made asynchronously so that Emacs will not block -- for
moderately complex source files, it can take some seconds simply
to fully expand them, as well as a little more time for the
drracket/check-syntax analysis. When the results are ready, all
annotations for the buffer are completely refreshed.

You may also set @ref{racket-xp-after-change-refresh-delay} to nil
and use the @code{racket-xp-annotate} command manually.

The mode line changes to reflect the current status of
annotations, and whether or not you had a syntax error.

If you have one or more syntax errors, @ref{racket-xp-next-error} and
@ref{racket-xp-previous-error} navigate among them. Although most
languages will stop after the first syntax error, some like Typed
Racket will try to collect and report multiple errors.

You may use @code{xref-find-definitions} @kbd{M-.} ,
@code{xref-pop-marker-stack} @kbd{M-,} , and
@code{xref-find-references}: @ref{racket-xp-mode} adds a backend to the
variable @code{xref-backend-functions}. This backend uses information
from the drracket/check-syntax static analysis. Its ability to
find references is limited to the current file; when it finds
none it will try the default xref backend implementation which is
grep-based.

Tip: This mode follows the convention that a minor mode may only
use a prefix key consisting of ``C-c'' followed by a punctuation
key. As a result, @code{racket-xp-control-c-hash-keymap} is bound to
``C-c #'' by default. Although you might find this awkward to
type, remember that as an Emacs user, you are free to bind this
map to a more convenient prefix, and/or bind any individual
commands directly to whatever keys you prefer.

@node racket-xp-describe
@subsection racket-xp-describe

@kbd{C-c C-.} 

Describe the identifier at point.

The command varies based on how many @kbd{C-u}  command prefixes you supply.

@itemize
@item
@kbd{C-c C-.} 

Uses the symbol at point. If no such symbol exists, you are
prompted enter the identifier, but in this case it only
considers definitions or imports at the file's module level --
not local bindings nor definitions in submodules.

@itemize
@item
If the identifier has installed Racket documentation, then a
simplified version of the HTML is presented in the buffer,
including the ``blue box'', documentation prose, and
examples.

@item
Otherwise, if the identifier is a function, then its
signature is displayed, for example "(name arg-1-name
arg-2-name)".
@end itemize

@item
@kbd{C-u}  @kbd{C-c C-.} 

Always prompts you to enter a symbol, defaulting to the symbol
at point if any.

@item
@kbd{C-u}  @kbd{C-u}  @kbd{C-c C-.} 

This is an alias for @ref{racket-describe-search}, which uses
installed documentation in a @code{racket-describe-mode} buffer
instead of an external web browser.
@end itemize

The intent is to give a quick reminder or introduction to
something, regardless of whether it has installed documentation
-- and to do so within Emacs, without switching to a web browser.

This buffer is also displayed when you use @code{company-mode} and
press F1 or C-h in its pop up completion list.

@node racket-xp-documentation
@subsection racket-xp-documentation

@kbd{C-c C-d} 

View documentation in an external web browser.

The command varies based on how many @kbd{C-u} 
command prefixes you supply.

@itemize
@item
@kbd{C-c C-d} 

Uses the symbol at point. Tries to find documentation for an
identifer defined in the expansion of the current buffer.

If no such identifer exists, opens the Search Manuals page. In
this case, the variable @ref{racket-documentation-search-location}
determines whether the search is done locally as with @code{raco
  doc}, or visits a URL.

@item
@kbd{C-u}  @kbd{C-c C-d} 

Always prompts you to enter a symbol, defaulting to the symbol
at point if any.

@item
@kbd{C-u}  @kbd{C-u}  @kbd{C-c C-d} 

Always prompts you to enter anything, defaulting to the symbol
at point if any.

Proceeds directly to the Search Manuals page. Use this if you
would like to see documentation for all identifiers named
``define'', for example.
@end itemize

@node racket-xp-next-definition

@kbd{C-c # k} 

Move point to the previous definition.

@node racket-xp-next-use
@subsection racket-xp-next-use

@kbd{C-c # n} 

When point is on a use, go to the next, sibling use.

@node racket-xp-previous-use
@subsection racket-xp-previous-use

@kbd{C-c # p} 

When point is on a use, go to the previous, sibling use.

@node racket-xp-next-error
@subsection racket-xp-next-error

@kbd{C-c # N} 

Go to the next error.

@node racket-xp-previous-error
@subsection racket-xp-previous-error

@kbd{C-c # P} 

Go to the previous error.

@node racket-xp-tail-up
@subsection racket-xp-tail-up

@kbd{C-c # ^} 

Go ``up'' to the expression enclosing an expression in tail position.

When point is on the opening parenthesis of an expression in tail
position, go its ``target'' -- that is, go to the enclosing
expression with the same continuation as the tail expression.

@node racket-xp-tail-down
@subsection racket-xp-tail-down

@kbd{C-c # v} 

Go ``down'' to the first tail position enclosed by the current expression.

@node racket-xp-tail-next-sibling
@subsection racket-xp-tail-next-sibling

@kbd{C-c # >} 

Go to the next tail position sharing the same enclosing expression.

@node racket-xp-tail-previous-sibling
@subsection racket-xp-tail-previous-sibling

@kbd{C-c # <} 

Go to the previous tail position sharing the same enclosing expression.

@node racket-documentation-search
@subsection racket-documentation-search

@kbd{C-c C-d} 

Search documentation.

This command is useful in several situations:

@itemize
@item
You are not using @ref{racket-xp-mode} for a @ref{racket-mode} edit
buffer, so @ref{racket-xp-documentation} is not available.

@item
There is no @ref{racket-repl-mode} buffer with a live namespace, so
@ref{racket-repl-documentation} is not available or helpful.

@item
You want to search for definitions provided by all modules --
for example, the ``define'' syntax provided by racket/base, by
typed/racket/base, and by other modules, as well definitions or
topics that merely include ``define''.
@end itemize

This command does not try to go directly to the help topic for a
definition provided by any specific module. Instead it goes to
the Racket ``Search Manuals'' page.

@node racket-describe-search
@subsection racket-describe-search

@kbd{C-c C-.}  or @kbd{C-c C-s} 

Search installed documentation; view using @code{racket-describe-mode}.

Always prompts you to enter a symbol, defaulting to the symbol at
point if any.

@itemize
@item
If just one module exports the name, you go directly to a
Racket Describe buffer with its documentation.

@item
If multiple modules export the name, you go first to a
``disambiguation'' buffer similar to the Racket ``Search
Manuals'' web page. You may press RET on any item to get a
Racket Describe buffer for that module's version of the thing.

@subsection racket-repl-mode

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-repl-mode}

Major mode for Racket REPL.

You may use @code{xref-find-definitions} @kbd{M-.}  and
@code{xref-pop-marker-stack} @kbd{M-,} :
@ref{racket-repl-mode} adds a backend to the variable
@code{xref-backend-functions}. This backend uses information about
identifier bindings and modules from the REPL's namespace.

In addition to any hooks its parent mode @code{comint-mode} might have run,
this mode runs the hook @code{racket-repl-mode-hook}, as the final step
during initialization.

@node racket-run
@subsection racket-run

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-run}

Save the buffer in REPL and run your program.

As well as evaluating the outermost, file module, automatically
runs the submodules specified by the customization variable
@ref{racket-submodules-to-run}.

See also @ref{racket-run-module-at-point}, which runs just the
specific module at point.

The command varies based on how many @kbd{C-u} 
prefix arguments you supply.

@itemize
@item
@kbd{<f5>} 

Follows the @ref{racket-error-context} setting.

@item
@kbd{C-u}  @kbd{<f5>} 

Uses errortrace for improved stack traces, as if
@ref{racket-error-context} were set to ``high''.

This lets you keep @ref{racket-error-context} set to a faster
value like ``low'' or ``medium'', then conveniently re-run
when you need a better strack trace.

@item
@kbd{C-u}  @kbd{C-u}  @kbd{<f5>} 

Instruments code for step debugging. See @ref{racket-debug-mode}
and the variable @ref{racket-debuggable-files}.
@end itemize

Each run occurs within a Racket custodian. Any prior run's
custodian is shut down, releasing resources like threads and
ports. Each run's evaluation environment is reset to the contents
of the source file. In other words, like Dr Racket, this provides
the benefit that your source file is the ``single source of
truth''. At the same time, the run gives you a REPL inside the
namespace of the module, giving you the ability to explore it
interactively. Any explorations are temporary, unless you also
make them to your source file, they will be lost on the next run.

See also @ref{racket-run-and-switch-to-repl}, which is even more like
Dr Racket's Run command because it selects the REPL window after
running.

In the @ref{racket-repl-mode} buffer, output that describes a file
and position is automatically ``linkified''. Examples of such
text include:

@itemize
@item
Racket error messages.
@item
rackunit test failure location messages.
@item
print representation of path objects.
@end itemize

To visit these locations, move point there and press RET or mouse
click. Or, use the standard @code{next-error} and @code{previous-error}
commands.

@node racket-run-and-switch-to-repl
@subsection racket-run-and-switch-to-repl

@kbd{<f5>} 

This is @ref{racket-run} followed by selecting the REPL buffer window.

This is similar to how Dr Racket behaves.

To make it even more similar, you may add @ref{racket-repl-clear} to
the variable @ref{racket-before-run-hook}.

@node racket-run-module-at-point
@subsection racket-run-module-at-point

@kbd{C-c C-k}  or @kbd{C-c C-c} 

Save the buffer and run the module at point.

Like @ref{racket-run} but runs the innermost module around point,
which is determined textually by looking for ``module'',
``module*'', or ``module+'' forms nested to any depth, else
simply the outermost, file module.

@node racket-repl
@subsection racket-repl

@kbd{C-c C-z} 

Show a Racket REPL buffer in some window.

@strong{IMPORTANT}

The main, intended use of Racket Mode's REPL is that you
@code{find-file} some specific .rkt file, then run it using
@ref{racket-run} or @ref{racket-run-module-at-point}. The resulting REPL
will correspond to those definitions and match your expectations.

If you really want to start a REPL for no file in particular,
then you could use this @ref{racket-repl} command. But the resulting
REPL will have a minimal ``#lang racket/base'' namespace. You
could enter "(require racket)" if you want the equivalent of
``#lang racket''. You could also "(require racket/enter)" if
you want things like ``enter!''. But in some sense you'd be
``using it wrong''. If you actually don't want to use Racket
Mode's REPL as intended, then consider using a plain Emacs
@code{shell} buffer to run command-line Racket.

@node racket-repl-describe
@subsection racket-repl-describe

@kbd{C-c C-.} 

Describe the identifier at point.

The command varies based on how many @kbd{C-u}  prefix arguments you supply.

@itemize
@item
@kbd{C-c C-.} 

Uses the symbol at point. If no such symbol exists, you are

not local bindings nor definitions in submodules.

@itemize
@item
If the identifier has installed Racket documentation, then a

-- and to do so within Emacs, without switching to a web browser.

@node racket-repl-documentation

View documentation in an external web browser.

The command varies based on how many @kbd{C-u}  command prefixes you supply.

@itemize
@item
@kbd{C-c C-d} 

Uses the symbol at point. Tries to find documentation for an
identifer defined in the current namespace.

If no such identifer exists, opens the Search Manuals page. In
this case, the variable @ref{racket-documentation-search-location}
determines whether the search is done locally as with @code{raco
  doc}, or visits a URL.

@item
@kbd{C-u}  @kbd{C-c C-d} 

Prompts you to enter a symbol, defaulting to the symbol at

@item
@kbd{C-u}  @kbd{C-u}  @kbd{C-c C-d} 

Prompts you to enter anything, defaulting to the symbol at

would like to see documentation for all identifiers named
``define'', for example.
@end itemize

@node racket-racket
@subsection racket-racket

@kbd{<C-M-f5>} 

Use command-line racket to run the file.

Uses a shell or terminal buffer as specified by the configuration
variable @ref{racket-shell-or-terminal-function}.

@node racket-profile
@subsection racket-profile

@kbd{C-c C-o} 

Like @ref{racket-run-module-at-point} but with profiling.

Results are presented in a @ref{racket-profile-mode} buffer, which
also lets you quickly view the source code.

You may evaluate expressions in the REPL. They are also profiled.
Use @code{racket-profile-refresh} to see the updated results. In
other words a possible workflow is: @ref{racket-profile} a .rkt file,
call one its functions in the REPL, and refresh the profile
results.

Caveat: Only source files are instrumented. You may need to
delete compiled/*.zo files.

@node racket-profile-mode
@subsection racket-profile-mode

@node racket-debug-mode
@subsection racket-debug-mode

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-debug-mode}

Minor mode for debug breaks.

This feature is @strong{@strong{EXPERIMENTAL}}!!! It is likely to have
significant limitations and bugs. You are welcome to open an
issue to provide feedback. Please understand that this feature
might never be improved -- it might even be removed someday if it
turns out to have too little value and/or too much cost.

How to debug:

@enumerate
@item
``Instrument'' code for step debugging.

Use two @kbd{C-u}  command prefixes for either
@ref{racket-run} or @ref{racket-run-module-at-point}.

The file will be instrumented for step debugging before it is
run. Any imported files are also instrumented if they are in
the variable @ref{racket-debuggable-files}.

The run will break at the first breakable position.

Tip: After you run to completion and return to a normal
REPL prompt, the code remains instrumented. You may enter
expressions that evaluate instrumented code and it will
break so you can step debug again.

@item
When a break occurs, the @ref{racket-repl-mode} prompt changes. In
this debug REPL, local variables are available for you to use
and even to @code{set!}.

Also, in the @ref{racket-mode} buffer where the break is located,
@ref{racket-debug-mode} is enabled. This minor mode makes the
buffer read-only, provides visual feedback -- about the break
position, local variable values, and result values -- and
provides shortcut keys:

@node racket-repl-clear
@subsection racket-repl-clear

Delete all text in the REPL.

A suitable value for the hook @ref{racket-before-run-hook} if you
want the REPL buffer to be cleared before each run, much like
with Dr Racket. To do so you can use @code{customize}, or, add to your
Emacs init file something like:

(add-hook `racket-before-run-hook #'racket-repl-clear)

See also the command @ref{racket-repl-clear-leaving-last-prompt}.

@node racket-repl-clear-leaving-last-prompt

@node racket-test
@subsection racket-test

@kbd{<C-f5>}  or @kbd{C-c C-t} 

Run the ``test'' submodule.

Put your tests in a ``test'' submodule. For example:

@example
    (module+ test
      (require rackunit)
      (check-true #t))
@end example

Any rackunit test failure messages show the location. You may use
@code{next-error} to jump to the location of each failing test.

With @kbd{C-u}  uses errortrace for improved stack traces.
Otherwise follows the @ref{racket-error-context} setting.

With @kbd{C-u}  @kbd{C-u}  also runs the
tests with coverage instrumentation and highlights uncovered code
using @code{font-lock-warning-face}.

Send the expression before point to the Racket REPL.

The expression may be either an at-expression or an s-expression.

When the expression is a sexp comment, the sexp itself is sent,
without the #; prefix.

With a prefix argument (e.g. @kbd{C-u}  @kbd{C-x C-e} ), the sexp is copied
into the REPL, followed by a ``;; ->'' line, to distinguish it
from the zero or more values to which it evaluates.

@node racket-expand-file
@subsection racket-expand-file

@kbd{C-c C-e f} 

Expand the @ref{racket-mode} buffer's file in @ref{racket-stepper-mode}.

Uses the @code{macro-debugger} package to do the expansion.

You do need to @ref{racket-run} the file first; the namespace
active in the REPL is not used.

If the file is non-trivial and/or is not compiled to a .zo
bytecode file, then it might take many seconds before the
original form is displayed and you can start stepping.

With @kbd{C-u}  also expands syntax from racket/base
-- which can result in very many expansion steps.

@node racket-expand-region
@subsection racket-expand-region

@kbd{C-c C-e r} 

Expand the active region using @ref{racket-stepper-mode}.

Uses Racket's @code{expand-once} in the namespace from the most recent
@ref{racket-run}.

@node racket-expand-definition
@subsection racket-expand-definition

@kbd{C-c C-e x} 

Expand the definition around point using @ref{racket-stepper-mode}.

@node racket-debug-toggle-breakpoint
@subsection racket-debug-toggle-breakpoint

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-debug-toggle-breakpoint}

Add or remove a breakpoint.

Each breakpoint has a condition and a list of actions.

The condition is a Racket expression that is evaluated in a
context where local variables exist. Examples:

@itemize
@item
``#t'' means break always.

@item
If the code around the breakpoint is something like
"(for ([n 100]) _)", then a condition like
"(zero? (modulo n 10))" is every 10 times through the
loop.
@end itemize

Actions is a list of symbols; you may specify one or more. The
action symbols are:

@itemize
@item
``break'' causes a break, enabling @ref{racket-debug-mode}.

@item
``log'' and ``print'' display information about local
variables to the logger or REPL output, respectively.
Although @ref{racket-debug-mode} already shows these values ``in
situ'' when you reach a break, this may be useful if you want
a history. Specifying ``log'' or ``print'', but not
``break'', is equivalent to what many debuggers call a
watchpoint instead of a breakpoint: Output some information
and automatically resume.
@end itemize

Note: Although @ref{racket-debug-mode} provides a convenient
keybinding, you may invoke this command anytime using M-x.

Note: If you're warned that point isn't known to be a breakable
position, that might be because it truly isn't, or, just because
you are not in @ref{racket-debug-mode} and the breakable positions
aren't yet known. Worst case, if you set a breakpoint someplace
that is not breakable, it is ignored. With a few exceptions --
such as close paren positions that are tail calls -- most open
parens and close parens are breakble positions.

@node racket-mode-start-faster
@subsection racket-mode-start-faster

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-mode-start-faster}

Compile Racket Mode's .rkt files for faster startup.

Racket Mode is implemented as an Emacs Lisp ``front end'' that
talks to a Racket process ``back end''. Because Racket Mode is
delivered as an Emacs package instead of a Racket package,
installing it does not do the @code{raco setup} that is normally done
for Racket packages.

This command will do a @code{raco make} of Racket Mode's .rkt files,
creating bytecode files in @code{compiled/} subdirectories. As a
result, when a command must start the Racket process, it will
start somewhat faster.

On many computers, the resulting speed up is negligible, and
might not be worth the complication.

If you run this command, ever, you will need to run it again
after:

@itemize
@item
Installing an updated version of Racket Mode. Otherwise, you
might lose some of the speed-up.

@item
Installing a new version of Racket and/or changing the value of
the variable @ref{racket-program}. Otherwise, you might get an
error message due to the bytecode being different versions.
@end itemize

To revert to compiling on startup, use
@ref{racket-mode-start-slower}. 

@node racket-mode-start-slower
@subsection racket-mode-start-slower

@kbd{M-x}  @code{racket-mode-start-slower}

@node racket-program
@subsection racket-program

Pathname of the Racket executable.

Note that a back end configuration can override this with a
non-nil @code{racket-program} property list value. See
@ref{racket-add-back-end}.

@node racket-command-timeout
@subsection racket-command-timeout

How many seconds to wait for command server responses.

Note: This is mostly obsolete, fortunately, because it applies
only to commands that must block the Emacs UI until they get a
response. Instead most Racket Mode commands these days receive
their response asychronously.

@node racket-memory-limit
@subsection racket-memory-limit

Terminate the Racket process if memory use exceeds this value in MB.

Changes to this value take effect upon the next @ref{racket-run}. A value
of 0 means no limit.

Caveat: This uses Racket's @code{custodian-limit-memory}, which does
not enforce the limit exactly. Instead, the program will be
terminated upon the first garbage collection where memory exceeds
the limit (maybe by a significant amount).

@node racket-error-context
@subsection racket-error-context

The amount of context for error messages.

Each increasing level supplies better context (``stack trace'')
for error messages, but causing your program to run more slowly.

@itemize
@item
low corresponds to compile-enforce-module-constants #t and
compile-context-preservation-enabled #f.

@item
medium corresponds to compile-enforce-module-constants #f and
compile-context-preservation-enabled #t, which disables some
optimizations like inlining.

@item
high corresponds to medium plus the use of errortrace, which
extensively instruments your code and therefore might cause
it to run significantly slower.
@end itemize

Tip: Regardless of this setting, you can enable high errortrace
for a specific @ref{racket-run} or @ref{racket-run-module-at-point} by
using @kbd{C-u} . This lets you normally run with a
lower, faster setting, and re-run when desired to get a
more-helpful error message.

@node racket-user-command-line-arguments
@subsection racket-user-command-line-arguments

List of command-line arguments to supply to your Racket program.

Accessible in your Racket program in the usual way --- the
parameter @code{current-command-line-arguments} and friends.

This is an Emacs buffer-local variable --- convenient to set as a
file local variable. For example at the end of your .rkt file:

@lisp
    ;; Local Variables:
    ;; racket-user-command-line-arguments: ("-f" "bar")
    ;; End:
@end lisp

Set this way, the value must be an @strong{unquoted} list of strings.
For example:

@lisp
    ("-f" "bar")
@end lisp

The following values will @emph{not} work:

@lisp
    '("-f" "bar")
    (list "-f" "bar")
@end lisp

@node racket-browse-url-function
@subsection racket-browse-url-function

Function to call to browse a URL.

@node racket-xp-after-change-refresh-delay
@subsection racket-xp-after-change-refresh-delay

Set to nil to disable automatic refresh and manually use @code{racket-xp-annotate}.

@node racket-xp-highlight-unused-regexp
@subsection racket-xp-highlight-unused-regexp

Only give @ref{racket-xp-unused-face} to unused bindings that match this regexp.

The default is to highlight identifiers that do not start with
an underline, which is a common convention.

@node racket-documentation-search-location
@subsection racket-documentation-search-location

The location of the Racket ``Search Manuals'' web page.
Where @ref{racket-documentation-search}, @ref{racket-xp-documentation}
and @ref{racket-repl-documentation} should look for the search page.

@itemize
@item
If the value of this variable is the symbol ``local'', open the
search page from the local documentation, as with ``raco doc''.

@item
Otherwise, the value is a string recognizable by @code{format}, with
``%s'' at the point at which to insert the user's search text
after applying @code{url-hexify-string}. Apart from ``%s'', the
string should be a properly encoded URL.

@node racket-repl-buffer-name-function
@subsection racket-repl-buffer-name-function

How to associate @ref{racket-mode} edit buffers with @ref{racket-repl-mode} buffers.

The default is nil, which is equivalent to supplying
@ref{racket-repl-buffer-name-shared}: One REPL buffer is shared.

Other predefined choices include @ref{racket-repl-buffer-name-unique}
and @ref{racket-repl-buffer-name-project}.

This is used when a @ref{racket-mode} buffer is created. Changing
this to a new value only affects @ref{racket-mode} buffers created
later.

Any such function takes no arguments, should look at the variable
@code{buffer-file-name} if necessary, and either @code{setq-default} or
@code{setq-local} the variable @code{racket-repl-buffer-name} to a desired
@ref{racket-repl-mode} buffer name. As a result, @ref{racket-run}
commands will use a buffer of that name, creating it if
necessary.

@node racket-submodules-to-run
@subsection racket-submodules-to-run

@ref{racket-images-inline} is true, and Emacs is built with with
ImageMagick support -- then @code{create-image} is called with
``imagemagick'' as the type and with this property list.

For example, to scale images whose width is larger than 500
pixels, supply (:max-width 500).

@node racket-images-keep-last
@subsection racket-images-keep-last

This is safe to set as a file-local variable.

@node racket-indent-sequence-depth

This affects the indentation of forms like '() `() #() --

#'() #`() ,() ,@@(). A zero value disables, giving the

and/or @code{racket-repl-mode-map} keymaps.

@node racket-logger-config
@subsection racket-logger-config

Configuration of @ref{racket-logger-mode} topics and levels.

The topic ``*'' respresents the default level used for topics not
assigned a level. Otherwise, the topic symbols are the same as
used by Racket's @code{define-logger}.

The levels are those used by Racket's logging system: ``debug'',
``info'', ``warning'', ``error'', ``fatal''.

For more information see:
  @uref{https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/logging.html}

The default value sets some known ``noisy'' topics to be one
level quieter. That way you can set the ``*'' topic to a level
like ``debug'' and not get overhwelmed by these noisy topics.

@node racket-before-run-hook
@subsection racket-before-run-hook

Normal hook done before various Racket Mode run commands.

When hook functions are called, @code{current-buffer} is that of the
@ref{racket-mode} buffer when the run command was issued. If a hook
function instead needs the @ref{racket-repl-mode} buffer, it should
get that from the variable @code{racket-repl-buffer-name}.

@node racket-after-run-hook
@subsection racket-after-run-hook

Normal hook done after various Racket Mode run commands.

Here ``after'' means that the run has completed and the REPL is
waiting at another prompt.

When hook functions are called, @code{current-buffer} is that of the
@ref{racket-mode} buffer when the run command was issued. If a hook
function instead needs the @ref{racket-repl-mode} buffer, it should
get that from the variable @code{racket-repl-buffer-name}.

@node racket-sexp-comment-fade

How much to fade faces used in s-expression comment bodies.

A number from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 is 0% fade and 1.0 is 100%
fade (invisible).

This feature works by creating faces that are alternatives for
faces used in s-expression comments. The alernative faces use a
faded foreground color. The colors are recalculated automatically
after you change the value of this customization variable and
after any @code{load-theme}. However in other circumstances you might

@node Showing information
@section Showing information

@node racket-show-functions
@subsection racket-show-functions

An ``abnormal hook'' variable to customize @code{racket-show}.

This is a list of one or more functions.

Each such function must accept two arguments: STR and POS.

STR is one of:

@itemize
@item
Non-blank string: Display the string somehow.

@item
Blank string: Hide any previously displayed string.

@item
nil: Hide any persistent UI that might have been created. For
instance @ref{racket-show-header-line} hides the header line.
@end itemize

POS may be nil when STR is nil or a blank string.

Otherwise POS is the buffer position -- typically the end of a
span -- that the non-blank STR describes.

A function that shows STR near POS should position it not to hide
the span, i.e. below and/or right of POS. Examples:
@ref{racket-show-pseudo-tooltip} and @ref{racket-show-pos-tip}.

A function that shows STR in a fixed location may of course
ignore POS. Examples: @ref{racket-show-echo-area} and
@ref{racket-show-header-line}

All @ref{racket-mode} buffers in a project share a @ref{racket-repl-mode} buffer.

A value for the variable @ref{racket-repl-buffer-name-function}.

The ``project'' is determined by @ref{racket-project-root}.

@node racket-project-root
@subsection racket-project-root

@code{(racket-project-root file)}


Given an absolute pathname for FILE, return its project root directory.

The ``project'' is determined by trying, in order:

@itemize
@item
@code{projectile-project-root}
@item
@code{vc-root-dir}
@item
@code{project-current}
@item
@code{file-name-directory}

@subsection racket-browse-url-using-temporary-file

@code{(racket-browse-url-using-temporary-file url &rest _args)}


Browse a URL via a temporary HTML file using a meta redirect.

A suitable value for the variable @ref{racket-browse-url-function}.

Racket documentation URLs depend on anchors -- the portion of the
URL after the # character -- to jump to a location within a page.
Unfortunately on some operating systems and/or versions of Emacs,
the default handling for browsing file URLs ignores anchors. This
function attempts to avoid the problem by using a temporary HTML
file with a meta redirect as a ``trampoline''.

Although the intent is to provide a default that ``just works'',
you do not need to use this. You can customize the variable
@ref{racket-browse-url-function} instead to be @code{browse-url}, or
@code{browse-url-browser-function} in case have have customized that,
or indeed whatever you want.

@code{(racket-add-back-end directory &rest plist)}


Add a description of a Racket Mode back end.

Racket Mode supports one or more back ends, which are Racket
processes supporting REPLs as well as various other Racket Mode
features.

DIRECTORY is a string describing a @code{file-name-absolute-p}
directory on some local or remote server.

When a back end's DIRECTORY is the longest matching prefix of a
buffer's @code{default-directory}, that back end is used for the
buffer.

DIRECTORY can be a local directory like ``/'' or
``/path/to/project'', or a @code{file-remote-p} directory like
``/user@@host:'' or ``/user@@host:/path/to/project''.

Note that you need not include a method -- such as the ``ssh'' in
``/ssh:user@@host:'' -- and if you do it is stripped: A back end
process is always started using SSH. Even if multiple buffers for
the same user+host+port use different methods, they will share
the same back end.

Practically speaking, DIRECTORY is a path you could give to
@code{find-file} to successfully find some local or remote file, but
omitting any method. (Some remote file shorthand forms get
expanded to at least ``/method:host:''. When in doubt check
@code{buffer-file-name} and follow its example.)

In addition to being used as a pattern to pick a back end for a
buffer, DIRECTORY determines:

@itemize
@item
Whether the back end is local or remote.

@item
The host name. Used to make TCP/IP connections to a back end
for REPL sesssions. When remote used for SSH connections to
start the back end process.

This may be a Host alias from ~/.ssh/config with a HostName, in
which case HostName is used as the actual host name for both
SSH and TCP/IP connections.

@item
When remote, any explicit user and port used to make SSH
connections (as opposed to relying on values from
~/.ssh/config).

@item
Other properties get reasonable defaults based on whether the
back end is local or remote, as described below.
@end itemize

After DIRECTORY, the remainining arguments are optional; they are
alternating :keywords and values describing some other properties
of a back end:

@itemize
@item
:racket-program

When not nil this is used instead of the value of the
customization variable @ref{racket-program}.

@item
:remote-source-dir

Where on a remote host to copy the back end's *.rkt files when
they do not exist or do not match the digest of the local
files. This must be @code{file-name-absolute-p} on the remote. Only
supply the localname there (not a full @code{file-remote-p}). The
default value is ``/tmp/racket-mode-back-end''.

@item
:repl-tcp-accept-host

Host from which the back end TCP REPL server will accept
connections. ``127.0.0.1'' means it will accept only local
connections. ``0.0.0.0'' means it will accept connections from
anywhere --- which usually is risky unless the remote is behind
a firewall that limits connections!

@item
:repl-tcp-port

The port number the back end TCP REPL server uses to listen for
connections.

Note that this is @code{numberp} --- not @code{stringp}.

When 0, this means the back end chooses an available port --- a
so-called ``ephemeral'' port. Usually that is practical only on
a local host. Otherwise a specific port number should be used,
and, remember to allow that in the remote's firewall.

@item
:windows

Whether the back end uses Windows style path names. Used to do
translation betwen slashes and backslashes between the Emacs
front end (which uses slashes even on Windows) and the Racket
back end (which expects native backslashes on Windows).

@item
:restart-watch-directories

A list of @code{directory-name-p} strings. Each directory, and
recursively its subdirectories, will be watched for file system
changes. After any changes are detected, the next
@ref{racket-run} (or @ref{racket-run-module-at-point} etc.) command
will ask you if it should restart the back end for you. This
may be helpful when you are changing source files used by the
back end.
@end itemize

The default property values are appropriate for whether
DIRECTORY is local or remote:

@itemize
@item
When DIRECTORY is remote, :repl-tcp-port is set to 55555,
:repl-tcp-accept-host is set to ``0.0.0.0'' (accepts
connections from anywhere), and :windows is nil.

When working with back ends on remote hosts, @strong{remember to check
your remote host firewall}. Your goal is to make sure things
work for you --- but only for you.

Probably you want the firewall to limit from where it accepts
SSH connections.

Also you need the firewall to accept connections on
:repl-tcp-port, but again, limiting from where --- either in
the firewall or by setting :repl-tcp-accept-host to a value
that is @emph{not} ``0.0.0.0''.

@item
Otherwise, reasonable defaults are used for a local back end:
:repl-tcp-port is set to 0 (meaning the back end picks an
ephemeral port), :repl-tcp-accept-host is set to ``127.0.0.1''
(meaning the back end only accept TCP connections locally),
and :windows is set based on @code{system-type}.
@end itemize

Although the default values usually ``just work'' for local and
remote back ends, you might want a special configuration. Here
are a few examples.

@lisp
    ;; 1. A back end configuration for "/" is
    ;; created automatically and works fine as a default
    ;; for buffers visiting local files, so we don't need
    ;; to add one here.

    ;; 2. However assume we want buffers under /var/tmp/8.0
    ;; instead to use Racket 8.0.
    (racket-add-back-end "/var/tmp/8.0"
                         :racket-program "~/racket/8.0/bin/racket")

    ;; 3. A back end configuration will be created
    ;; automatically for buffers visiting file names like
    ;; "/ssh:user@@linode", so we don't need to add one here.
    ;;
    ;; If ~/.ssh/config defines a Host alias named "linode",
    ;; with HostName and User settings, a file name as simple as
    ;; "/linode:" would work fine with tramp -- and the
    ;; automatically created back end configuration would work
    ;; fine, too.

    ;; 4. For example's sake, assume for buffers visiting
    ;; /ssh:headless:~/gui-project/ we want :racket-program instead
    ;; to be "xvfb-run racket".
    (racket-add-back-end "/ssh:headless:~/gui-project/"
                         :racket-program "xvfb-run racket")
