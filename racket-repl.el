features will work, such as completion, visiting definitions, and
so on.

If the REPL isn't running, and you want to start it for no file

could enter \"(require racket)\" if you want the equivalent of
\"#lang racket\". You could also \"(require racket/enter)\" if
you want things like \"enter!\". But in some sense you'd be
