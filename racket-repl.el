;;; racket-mode <=> racket-repl-mode associations

;; There are some nuances here regarding these variables being
;; buffer-local or not, and, whether the variables have any meaning in
;; certain modes, or not. We use Emacs variable semantics to handle
;; the association between `racket-mode' edit buffers and
;; `racket-repl-mode' buffers, for a variety of use cases the user
;; might prefer. These range from all edit buffers sharing one REPL
;; buffer (the traditional default for Racket Mode), up to each edit
;; buffers having its own REPL (as in Dr Racket), or anything in
;; between (such as one REPL per projectile project, or whatever).
;; Some of these scenarios might benefit from some higher-level UI.
;; But ultimately they reduce to setting the variable
;; `racket-repl-buffer-name' globally and/or locally for `racket-mode'
;; buffers -- that is the fundamental representation. Similarly, each
;; `racket-repl-mode' buffer has an always-buffer-local value for the
;; variable `racket--repl-session-id'. (Note that
;; `racket-repl-buffer-name' only has meaning for `racket-mode'
;; buffers, and `racket--repl-session-id' only has meaning for
;; `racket-repl-mode' buffers. Emacs variables exist for all buffers
;; using all major modes. All we can do is remember in which buffers
;; they mean something as opposed to being ignored..)

As well as evaluating the outermost, file module, automatically
runs the submodules specified by the customization variable

See also `racket-run-module-at-point', which runs just the
specific module at point.

With \\[universal-argument] uses errortrace for improved stack traces.
Otherwise follows the `racket-error-context' setting.

With \\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument] instruments
code for step debugging. See `racket-debug-mode' and the variable
`racket-debuggable-files'.

Each run occurs within a Racket custodian. Any prior run's
custodian is shut down, releasing resources like threads and
ports. Each run's evaluation environment is reset to the contents
of the source file. In other words, like Dr Racket, this provides
the benefit that your source file is the \"single source of
truth\". At the same time, the run gives you a REPL inside the
namespace of the module, giving you the ability to explore it
interactively. Any explorations are temporary, unless you also
make them to your source file, they will be lost on the next run.

See also `racket-run-and-switch-to-repl', which is even more like
Dr Racket's Run command because it selects the REPL window after
running.

In the `racket-repl-mode' buffer, output that describes a file
and position is automatically \"linkified\". Examples of such
text include:

- Racket error messages.
- rackunit test failure location messages.
- print representation of path objects.

click. Or, use the standard `next-error' and `previous-error'

Racket is not a very \"eldoc friendly\" language.

Sometimes we can discover argument lists from source -- but this
can be slow.

For code that has been run in the REPL, we can use its namespace
to discover contracts or types -- but otherwise we cannot.

Many interesting Racket forms are syntax (macros) without any
easy way to discover their \"argument lists\". Similarly many
Racket functions or syntax are defined in #%kernel and the source
is not available. If they have documentation with a \"bluebox\",
we can show it -- but often it is not a single-line format
typical for eldoc.

So if you are expecting an eldoc experience similar to Emacs
Lisp, you will be disappointed.

A more satisfying experience is to use `racket-repl-describe' or

The command varies based on how many \\[universal-argument] command prefixes you supply.

1. None.

   Uses the symbol at point. Tries to find documentation for an
   identifer defined in the current namespace.

   If no such identifer exists, opens the Search Manuals page. In
   this case, the variable `racket-documentation-search-location'
   determines whether the search is done locally as with `raco

2. \\[universal-argument]

   Prompts you to enter a symbol, defaulting to the symbol at
   point if any.

   Otherwise behaves like 1.

3. \\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument]

   Prompts you to enter anything, defaulting to the symbol at

   Proceeds directly to the Search Manuals page. Use this if you
