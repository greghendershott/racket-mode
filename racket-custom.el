;;; All `defcustom's and `defface's go here.
;;; This makes it easier to provide a consistent UI.

;; NOTE: `:prefix` is disabled as of Emacs 24.3, so I'm using explicit
;; `:tag`s. But also note that options are sorted (by default; user
;; can turn that off) based on the identifier name not the `:tag`. As
;; a result, I'm defining `:tag`s AS IF `:prefix "racket-"` did work.
;; In other words defcustom of racket-foo-bar has a :tag "Foo Bar".
