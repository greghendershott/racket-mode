;; and letting the exit-handler in run.rkt cleanup the TCP connection.
;; This handles the case where e.g. the user kills the REPL buffer and
;; its process on the client/Emacs side. We used to have code here in
;; an effort support lang/datalog using eof as an expression separator
;; -- but that just causes an endless loop 100% CPU spike with an
;; abandoned tcp-input-port. So give up on that, reverting issue #305.
