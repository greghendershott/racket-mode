;; Command requests and responses are a subset of valid Emacs Lisp
;; s-expressions: See elisp-read and elisp-write.
;;
;; Command requests are (nonce session-id command param ...).
;;
;; `session-id` should be a REPL session ID returned from opening a
;; new connection to the REPL server, for commands that need to be
;; associated with a specific REPL session. (For other commands, this
;; may be nil a.k.a. #f).
;;
;; A thread is spun off to handle each request, so that a long-running
;; command won't block others. The nonce supplied with the request is
;; returned with the response, so that the client can match the
;; response with the request. The nonce needn't be random, just
;; unique; an increasing integer is fine.
;;
;; Command responses are (nonce 'ok sexp ...+) or (nonce 'error
;; "message") or (nonce 'break). The 'error response normally can and
;; should be displayed to the user in Emacs via error or message. We
;; handle exn:fail? up here; generally we're fine letting Racket
;; exceptions percolate up and be shown to the user. The 'break
;; response is for commands that can be aborted by other commands.
;; Typically our Emacs code will silently ignore these; the
;; affirmative break response allows the command callback to be
;; cleaned up.

  ;; Because we have multiple command threads running, we should
