limitations on what it can or should do -- CALLBACK is not called

Important: Do not assume that `current-buffer' is the same when
CALLBACK is called, as it was when the command was sent. If you

\"error\" responses are handled here. Note: We use `message' not

  2. More simply, we don't need to escape any call stack, we only
     need to ... not call the callback!

\"break\" responses are handled here, too. This is used when a
command is somehow canceled, with no useful response except the
