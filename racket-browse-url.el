  "Browse a URL via a temporary HTML file using a meta redirect.

A suitable value for the variable `racket-browse-url-function'.

Racket documentation URLs depend on anchors -- the portion of the
URL after the # character -- to jump to a location within a page.
Unfortunately on some operating systems and/or versions of Emacs,
the default handling for browsing file URLs ignores anchors. This
function attempts to avoid the problem by using a temporary HTML
file with a meta redirect as a \"trampoline\".

Although the intent is to provide a default that \"just works\",
you do not need to use this. You can customize the variable
`racket-browse-url-function' instead to be `browse-url', or
`browse-url-browser-function' in case have have customized that,
or indeed whatever you want."
