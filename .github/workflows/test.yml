  # The motivation for this job is to see if tests are likely to pass
  # when run on headless servers such as Debian `buildd` with the
  # Minimal Racket distriubtion (or equivalent), plus manually
  # installing the Racket packages recommended in our documentation.
  # The tests themselves should detect the absence of a display or a
  # missing Racket package and skip. See *** in comments below.
