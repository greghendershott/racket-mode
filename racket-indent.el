;; The two top-level commands we care about are:
;;   1. `prog-indent-sexp' C-M-q
;;   2. `indent-region' C-M-\
;;
;; 1. `prog-indent-sexp' thinly wraps `indent-region'.
;;
;; 2. `indent-region' calls `indent-according-to-mode', which in turn
;; calls the mode-specific `indent-line-function'. In lisp-mode that's
;; `lisp-indent-line', which in turn calls `calculate-lisp-indent'.
;; That in turn calls the mode-specific `indent-function'; in
;; lisp-mode that's `lisp-indent-function'.
;;
;; However `calculate-lisp-indent' is complicated and doesn't always
;; behave the way we want. So we use a simplified version of that
;; (`racket--calculate-indent') in our `indent-line-function',
;; `racket-indent-line'. That just directly calls
;; `racket-indent-function'.

;; Having said all that, we still have the matter of `paredit-mode'.
;; It directly calls `lisp-indent-line' instead of
;; `indent-line-function'. And, it directly calls `indent-sexp'
;; instead of `prog-indent-sexp'. Therefore it gets `lisp-mode'
;; indent, not ours. To address this, advise those two functions to do
;; the right thing when one of our major modes is active.

  "Indent current line as Racket code.

Normally you don't invoke this command directly. Instead, because
it is used as the value for the variable `indent-line-function'
in `racket-mode' and `racket-repl-mode' buffers, it is used
automatically when you press keys like RET or TAB. However you
might refer to it when configuring custom indentation, explained
below.

Following the tradition of `lisp-mode' and `scheme-mode', the
primary way to determine the indentation of a form is to look for
a rule stored as a `racket-indent-function' property.

To extend, use your Emacs init file to

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (put SYMBOL \\='racket-indent-function INDENT)
#+END_SRC

SYMBOL is the name of the Racket form like \"test-case\" and
INDENT is an integer or the symbol \"defun\". When INDENT is an
integer, the meaning is the same as for lisp-indent-function and
scheme-indent-function: Indent the first INDENT arguments
specially and indent any further arguments like a body. (The
number may be negative; see discussion below.)

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (put \\='test-case \\='racket-indent-function 1)
#+END_SRC

This will change the indent of `test-case` from this:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
    (test-case foo
               blah
               blah)
#+END_SRC

to this:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
    (test-case foo
      blah
      blah)
#+END_SRC

For backward compatibility, if `racket-indent-function' has no
property for a symbol, a scheme-indent-function property is also
considered, although the \"with-\" indents defined by scheme-mode
are ignored. This is only to help people who may have extensive
scheme-indent-function settings, particularly in the form of file
or dir local variables. Otherwise prefer putting properties on
`racket-indent-function'.

If no explicit rules match, regular expressions are used for a
couple special cases:

- Forms that start with \"begin\" indent like \"begin\".

- Forms that start with \"def\" or \"with-\" indent like
  \"define\".

On the one hand this is convenient when you create your own
\"DRY\" macros; they will indent as expected without you needing
to make custom indent rules. On the other hand there can be false
matches; for example a function or form named \"defer\" will
indent like \"define\". This is a known drawback and is unlikely
to be fixed unless/until Racket macros someday support a protocol
to communicate how they should be indented.

There is also automatic handling for:

- Forms that begin with a #:keyword (as found in contracts)

- Literal forms like #hasheq()

- Quoted forms when the variable `racket-indent-sequence-depth'
  is > 0.

- {} forms when the variable `racket-indent-curly-as-sequence' is
  not nil.

Finally and otherwise, a form will be indented as if it were a
procedure application.

--- --- ---

Note: Racket Mode extends the traditional Emacs lisp indent spec
to allow a /negative/ integer, which means that all distinguished
forms should align with the first one. This style originated with
\"for/fold\", which has two distinguished forms. Traditionally
those would indent like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
    (for/fold ([x xs])
        ([y ys])            ; twice body indent
      body)
#+END_SRC

However the popularly desired indent is:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
    (for/fold ([x xs])
              ([y ys])      ; same as first distingushed form
      body)
#+END_SRC

This idea extends to optional distinguished forms, such as Typed
Racket annotation \"prefixes\" in \"for/fold\", \"for/x\", and
even \"let\" forms:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
    (for/fold : Type
              ([x xs])
              ([y ys])      ; same as first distingushed form
      body)
#+END_SRC
