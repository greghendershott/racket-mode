;; Copied from lisp-mode but heavily modified
(defun racket-indent-function (indent-point state)
  "Racket mode function for the value of the variable `lisp-indent-function'.
This behaves like the function `lisp-indent-function', except that:

i) it checks for a non-nil value of the property `racket-indent-function'
rather than `lisp-indent-function'.

ii) if that property specifies a function, it is called with three
arguments (not two), the third argument being the default (i.e., current)
indentation.

The function `calculate-lisp-indent' calls this to determine
if the arguments of a Lisp function call should be indented specially.

INDENT-POINT is the position at which the line being indented begins.
Point is located at the point to indent under (for default indentation);
STATE is the `parse-partial-sexp' state for that position.

If the current line is in a call to a Lisp function that has a non-nil
property `racket-indent-function' it specifies how to indent.  The property
value can be:

* `defun', meaning indent `defun'-style
  \(this is also the case if there is no property and the function
  has a name that begins with \"def\", and three or more arguments);

* an integer N, meaning indent the first N arguments specially
  (like ordinary function arguments), and then indent any further
  arguments like a body;

* a function to call that returns the indentation (or nil).
  `lisp-indent-function' calls this function with the same two arguments
  that it itself received.

This function returns either the indentation to use, or nil if the
Lisp function does not specify a special indentation."
