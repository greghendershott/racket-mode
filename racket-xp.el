;;;###autoload
(define-minor-mode racket-xp-mode
  "A minor mode that analyzes expanded code to explain and explore.

This minor mode is an optional enhancement to `racket-mode' edit
buffers. Like any minor mode, you can turn it on or off for a
specific buffer. If you always want to use it, put the following
code in your Emacs init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (require \\='racket-xp)
    (add-hook \\='racket-mode-hook #\\='racket-xp-mode)
#+END_SRC

Note: This mode won't do anything unless/until the Racket Mode
back end is running. It will try to start the back end
automatically. You do /not/ need to `racket-run' the buffer you
are editing.

This mode uses the drracket/check-syntax package to analyze
fully-expanded programs, without needing to evaluate a.k.a.
\"run\" them. The resulting analysis provides information for:

- Visually annotating bindings -- local or imported definitions
  and references to them.

- Visually annotating expressions in a tail position, as well as
  the enclosing expression with respect to which they are in a
  tail position.

- Completion candidates.

- Defintions' source and documentation.

When point is on a definition or use, related items are
highlighted using `racket-xp-def-face' and `racket-xp-use-face'
-- instead of drawing arrows as in Dr Racket. Information is
displayed using the function(s) in the hook variable
`racket-show-functions'; it is also available when hovering the
mouse cursor.

Note: If you find these point-motion features too distracting
and/or slow, in your `racket-xp-mode-hook' you may disable them:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require \\='racket-xp)
  (add-hook \\='racket-xp-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (remove-hook \\='pre-redisplay-functions
                           #\\='racket-xp-pre-redisplay
                           t)))
#+END_SRC

The remaining features discussed below will still work.

You may also use commands to navigate among a definition and its
uses, or to rename a local definitions and all its uses:

  - `racket-xp-next-definition'
  - `racket-xp-previous-definition'
  - `racket-xp-next-use'
  - `racket-xp-previous-use'

In the following little example, not only does
drracket/check-syntax distinguish the various \"x\" bindings, it
understands the two different imports of \"define\":

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
  #lang racket/base
  (define x 1)
  x
  (let ([x x])
    (+ x 1))
  (module m typed/racket/base
    (define x 2)
    x)
#+END_SRC

When point is on the opening parenthesis of an expression in tail
position, it is highlighted using the face
`racket-xp-tail-position-face'.

When point is on the opening parenthesis of an enclosing
expression with respect to which one or more expressions are in
tail position, it is highlighted using the face
`racket-xp-tail-target-face'.

Furthermore, when point is on the opening parenthesis of either
kind of expression, all of the immediately related expressions
are also highlighted. Various commands move among them:

  - `racket-xp-tail-up'
  - `racket-xp-tail-down'
  - `racket-xp-tail-next-sibling'
  - `racket-xp-tail-previous-sibling'

The function `racket-xp-complete-at-point' is added to the
variable `completion-at-point-functions'. Note that in this case,
it is not smart about submodules; identifiers are assumed to be
definitions from the file's module or its imports. In addition to
supplying completion candidates, it supports the
\":company-location\" property to inspect the definition of a
candidate and the \":company-doc-buffer\" property to view its
documentation.

When you edit the buffer, existing annotations are retained;
their positions are updated to reflect the edit. Annotations for
new or deleted text are not requested until after
`racket-xp-after-change-refresh-delay' seconds. The request is
made asynchronously so that Emacs will not block -- for
moderately complex source files, it can take some seconds simply
to fully expand them, as well as a little more time for the
drracket/check-syntax analysis. When the results are ready, all
annotations for the buffer are completely refreshed.

You may also set `racket-xp-after-change-refresh-delay' to nil
and use the `racket-xp-annotate' command manually.

The mode line changes to reflect the current status of
annotations, and whether or not you had a syntax error.

If you have one or more syntax errors, `next-error' and
`previous-error' navigate among them. Although most languages
will stop after the first syntax error, some like Typed Racket
will try to collect and report multiple errors.

You may use `xref-find-definitions' \\[xref-find-definitions],
`xref-pop-marker-stack' \\[xref-pop-marker-stack], and
`xref-find-references': `racket-xp-mode' adds a backend to the
variable `xref-backend-functions'. This backend uses information
from the drracket/check-syntax static analysis. Its ability to
find references is limited to the current file; when it finds
none it will try the default xref backend implementation which is
grep-based.

Tip: This mode follows the convention that a minor mode may only
use a prefix key consisting of \"C-c\" followed by a punctuation
key. As a result, `racket-xp-control-c-hash-keymap' is bound to
\"C-c #\" by default. Although you might find this awkward to
type, remember that as an Emacs user, you are free to bind this
map to a more convenient prefix, and/or bind any individual
commands directly to whatever keys you prefer.

Although most of `eldoc-box-buffer-setup' is necessary for

1. It runs `eldoc-buffer-hook' functions to massage markdown; N/A.

2. It enables `visual-line-mode', which might add line breaks.

To further avoid extra line breaks and continuation marks in the
fringe, we also want to enable `truncate-lines', as does
`racket-describe-mode'.

Extra line breaks are especially bad when `racket-xp-eldoc-level'

documentation HTML, which makes heavy use of HTML tables, and
we've worked hard to help shr to convert these correctly."
