(define-minor-mode racket-xp-mode
  "A minor mode that analyzes expanded code to explain and explore.

This minor mode is an optional enhancement to `racket-mode' edit
buffers. Like any minor mode, you can turn it on or off for a
specific buffer. If you always want to use it, put the following
code in your Emacs init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (require 'racket-xp)
    (add-hook 'racket-mode-hook #'racket-xp-mode)
#+END_SRC

Note: This mode won't do anything unless/until the Racket Mode
back end is running. It will try to start the back end
automatically. You do /not/ need to `racket-run' the buffer you
are editing.

This mode uses the drracket/check-syntax package to analyze
fully-expanded programs, without needing to evaluate a.k.a.
\"run\" them. The resulting analysis provides information for:

- Visually annotating bindings -- local or imported definitions
  and references to them.

- Completion candidates.

- Defintions' source and documentation.

When point is on a definition or use, related items are
highlighted using `racket-xp-def-face' and `racket-xp-use-face'
-- instead of drawing arrows as in Dr Racket. Information is
displayed using the function(s) in the hook variable
`racket-show-functions'; it is also available when hovering the
mouse cursor.

Note: If you find these point-motion features too distracting
and/or slow, in your `racket-xp-mode-hook' you may disable them:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'racket-xp)
  (add-hook 'racket-xp-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (remove-hook 'pre-redisplay-functions
                           #'racket-xp-pre-redisplay
                           t))
#+END_SRC

The remaining features discussed below will still work.

You may also use commands to navigate among a definition and its
uses, or to rename a local definitions and all its uses.

In the following little example, not only does
drracket/check-syntax distinguish the various \"x\" bindings, it
understands the two different imports of \"define\":

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
  #lang racket/base
  (define x 1)
  x
  (let ([x x])
    (+ x 1))
  (module m typed/racket/base
    (define x 2)
    x)
#+END_SRC

The function `racket-xp-complete-at-point' is added to the
variable `completion-at-point-functions'. Note that in this case,
it is not smart about submodules; identifiers are assumed to be
definitions from the file's module or its imports. In addition to
supplying completion candidates, it supports the
\":company-location\" property to inspect the definition of a
candidate and the \":company-doc-buffer\" property to view its
documentation.

When you edit the buffer, existing annotations are retained;
their positions are updated to reflect the edit. Annotations for
new or deleted text are not requested until after
`racket-xp-after-change-refresh-delay' seconds. The request is
made asynchronously so that Emacs will not block -- for
moderately complex source files, it can take some seconds simply
to fully expand them, as well as a little more time for the
drracket/check-syntax analysis. When the results are ready, all
annotations for the buffer are completely refreshed.

You may also set `racket-xp-after-change-refresh-delay' to nil
and use the `racket-xp-annotate' command manually.

The mode line changes to reflect the current status of
annotations, and whether or not you had a syntax error.

If you have one or more syntax errors, `racket-xp-next-error' and
`racket-xp-previous-error' to navigate among them. Although most
languages will stop after the first syntax error, some like Typed
Racket will try to collect and report multiple errors.

Tip: This mode follows the convention that a minor mode may only
use a prefix key consisting of \"C-c\" followed by a punctuation
key. As a result, `racket-xp-control-c-hash-keymap' is bound to
\"C-c #\" by default. Although you might find this awkward to
type, remember that as an Emacs user, you are free to bind this
map to a more convenient prefix, and/or bind any individual
commands directly to whatever keys you prefer.

This buffer is also displayed when you use `company-mode' and
press F1 or C-h in its pop up completion list.

- If the identifier has installed Racket documentation, then a
  simplified version of the HTML is presented in the buffer,
  including the \"blue box\", documentation prose, and examples.

- Otherwise, if the identifier is a function, then its signature
  is displayed, for example \"(name arg-1-name arg-2-name)\".

You can quit the buffer by pressing q. Also, at the bottom of the

TAB, and activate using RET -- for `racket-xp-visit-definition'

(defun racket-xp-eldoc-function ()
  "A value for the variable `eldoc-documentation-function'.

By default `racket-xp-mode' sets `eldoc-documentation-function'
to nil -- no `eldoc-mode' support. You may set it to this
function in a `racket-xp-mode-hook' if you really want to use
`eldoc-mode'. But it is not a very satisfying experience because
Racket is not a very \"eldoc friendly\" language.

Sometimes we can discover function signatures from source -- but
this can be slow.

Many interesting Racket forms are syntax (macros) without any
easy way to discover their \"argument lists\". Similarly many
Racket functions or syntax are defined in #%kernel and the source
is not available. If they have documentation with a \"bluebox\",
we can show it -- but often it is not a single-line format
typical for eldoc.

Finally, when `racket-xp-after-change-refresh-delay' is a small
value, you may start to type some expression, and pause for
guidance from `eldoc-mode'. However in its incomplete form your
expression might be a syntax error. The resulting error message
might \"fight\" with `eldoc-mode' in the echo area. You could
avoid this by setting the variable `racket-show-functions' not to
include `racket-show-echo-area'. Even so, and worse, the syntax
error might result in a namespace that is empty -- in which case
we won't find blueboxes, types, or contracts.

So if you are expecting an eldoc experience similar to Emacs
Lisp, you will be disappointed.

A more satisfying experience is to use `racket-xp-describe'
or `racket-repl-describe'."
