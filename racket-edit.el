Adds explicit requires for imports that are provided by

This is a recommended optimization for Racket applications.
Avoiding loading all of \"racket\" can reduce load time and
memory footprint.

Also, as does `racket-trim-requires', this removes unneeded
modules and tidies everything into a single, sorted require form.

;;; align

(defun racket-align ()
  "Align values in the same column.

Useful for binding forms like \"let\" and \"parameterize\",
conditionals like \"cond\" and \"match\", association lists, and
any series of couples like the arguments to \"hash\".

Before choosing this command, put point on the first of a series
of \"couples\". A couple is:

- A list of two or more sexprs: \"[sexpr val sexpr ...]\".
- Two sexprs: \"sexpr val\".

Each \"val\" moves to the same column and is
`prog-indent-sexp'-ed (in case it is a multi-line form).

For example with point on the \"[\" before \"a\":

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
    Before             After

    (let ([a 12]       (let ([a   12]
          [bar 23])          [bar 23])
      ....)              ....)

    ([a . 12]          ([a   . 12]
     [bar . 23])        [bar . 23])

    (cond [a? #t]      (cond [a?   #t]
          [b? (f x           [b?   (f x
                 y)]                  y)]
          [else #f])         [else #f])
#+END_SRC

Or with point on the quote before \"a\":

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
    (list a 12        (list a   12
          bar 23)           bar 23)
#+END_SRC

If more than one couple is on the same line, none are aligned,
because it is unclear where the value column should be. For
example the following form will not change; `racket-align' will
display an error message:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
    (let ([a 0][b 1]
          [c 2])       error; unchanged
      ....)
#+END_SRC

When a couple's sexprs start on different lines, that couple is
ignored. Other, single-line couples in the series are aligned as
usual. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
    (let ([foo         (let ([foo
           0]                 0]
          [bar 1]            [bar 1]
          [x 2])             [x   2])
      ....)              ....)
#+END_SRC
