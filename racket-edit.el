(defun racket-run (&optional errortracep)
  "Save and evaluate the buffer in REPL, much like DrRacket's Run.

With a C-u prefix, uses errortrace for improved stack traces.
Otherwise follows the `racket-error-context' setting.

If point is within a Racket `module` form, the REPL \"enters\"
that submodule (uses its language info and namespace).

When you run again, the file is evaluated from scratch -- the
custodian releases resources like threads and the evaluation
environment is reset to the contents of the file. In other words,
like DrRacket, this provides the predictability of a \"static\"
baseline, plus the ability to explore interactively using the
REPL.

See also `racket-run-and-switch-to-repl', which is even more like
DrRacket's Run because it selects the REPL window (gives it the
focus), too.

If your source file has a syntax or runtime error, a \"skeleton\"
of your file is evaluated to get identifiers from module
languages, `require`s, and definitions. That way, things like
completion and `racket-describe' are more likely to work while
you edit the file to fix the error. If not even the \"skeleton\"
evaluation succeeds, you'll have only identifiers provided by
racket/base, until you fix the error and run again.

Output in the `*Racket REPL*` buffer that describes a file and
position is automatically \"linkified\". Examples of such text
include:

- Racket error messages.
- `rackunit` test failure location messages.
- `print`s of `#<path>` objects.

To visit these locations, move point there and press RET or mouse
click. Or, use the standard `next-error' and `previous-error'
commands.

In the `*Racket REPL*` buffer you can issue some special
commands. Some of them are the foundation for Emacs commands.
Others are available only as a command in the REPL.

- `,help`: See these commands.

- `,top`: Reset the REPL to an empty module (i.e. a racket/base namespace).

- `,run <module>` : What `racket-run' uses.
  - `<module> = <file> | (<file> <submodule-id> ...)`
  - `<file> = file.rkt | /path/to/file.rkt | \"file.rkt\" | \"/path/to/file.rkt\"`

- `,exit`: Exit Racket. Handy in a `#lang` like r5rs where the
  `exit` procedure is not available. (Regardless of how Racket
  exits, the `*Racket REPL*` buffer is not killed and is reused
  if you `racket-run' again.)

- `,doc <symbol-or-string>`: Look for `<symbol-or-string>` in
  Racket's documentation. What `racket-doc' uses.

- `,cd`, `,pwd`: Change and show `current-directory`."

;;; align

(defun racket-align ()
  "Align values in the same column.

Useful for binding forms like `let` and `parameterize`,
conditionals like `cond` and `match`, association lists, and any
series of couples like the arguments to `hash`.

Before choosing this command, put point on the first of a series
of \"couples\". A couple is:

- A list of two or more sexprs: `[sexpr val sexpr ...]`
- Two sexprs: `sexpr val`.

Each `val` moves to the same column and is
`prog-indent-sexp'-ed (in case it is a multi-line form).

For example with point on the `[` before `a`:

    Before             After

    (let ([a 12]       (let ([a   12]
          [bar 23])          [bar 23])
      ....)              ....)

    '([a . 12]         '([a   . 12]
      [bar . 23])        [bar . 23])

    (cond [a? #t]      (cond [a?   #t]
          [b? (f x           [b?   (f x
                 y)]                  y)]
          [else #f])         [else #f])

Or with point on the `'` before `a`:

    (list 'a 12        (list 'a   12
          'bar 23)           'bar 23)

If more than one couple is on the same line, none are aligned,
because it is unclear where the value column should be. For
example the following form will not change; `racket-align' will
display an error message:

    (let ([a 0][b 1]
          [c 2])       error; unchanged
      ....)

When a couple's sexprs start on different lines, that couple is
ignored. Other, single-line couples in the series are aligned as
usual. For example:

    (let ([foo         (let ([foo
           0]                 0]
          [bar 1]            [bar 1]
          [x 2])             [x   2])
      ....)              ....)
