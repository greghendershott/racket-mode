(defun racket-run (&optional prefix)
  "Save and evaluate the buffer in REPL.

With one C-u prefix, uses errortrace for improved stack traces.
Otherwise follows the `racket-error-context' setting.

With two C-u prefixes, instruments code for step debugging. See
`racket-debug-mode' and the variable `racket-debuggable-files'.

If point is within a Racket `module` form, the REPL \"enters\"
that submodule (uses its language info and namespace).

When you run again, the file is evaluated from scratch -- the
custodian releases resources like threads and the evaluation
environment is reset to the contents of the file. In other words,
like DrRacket, this provides the predictability of a \"static\"
baseline, plus the ability to explore interactively using the
REPL.

See also `racket-run-and-switch-to-repl', which is even more like
DrRacket's Run because it selects the REPL window (gives it the
focus), too.

When `racket-retry-as-skeleton' is true, if your source file has
an error, a \"skeleton\" of your file is evaluated to get
identifiers from module languages, `require`s, and definitions.
That way, things like completion and `racket-describe' are more
likely to work while you edit the file to fix the error. If not
even the \"skeleton\" evaluation succeeds, you'll have only
identifiers provided by racket/base, until you fix the error and
run again.

Output in the `*Racket REPL*` buffer that describes a file and
position is automatically \"linkified\". Examples of such text
include:

- Racket error messages.
- `rackunit` test failure location messages.
- `print`s of `#<path>` objects.

To visit these locations, move point there and press RET or mouse
click. Or, use the standard `next-error' and `previous-error'
commands."

;;; align

(defun racket-align ()
  "Align values in the same column.

Useful for binding forms like `let` and `parameterize`,
conditionals like `cond` and `match`, association lists, and any
series of couples like the arguments to `hash`.

Before choosing this command, put point on the first of a series
of \"couples\". A couple is:

- A list of two or more sexprs: `[sexpr val sexpr ...]`
- Two sexprs: `sexpr val`.

Each `val` moves to the same column and is
`prog-indent-sexp'-ed (in case it is a multi-line form).

For example with point on the `[` before `a`:

    Before             After

    (let ([a 12]       (let ([a   12]
          [bar 23])          [bar 23])
      ....)              ....)

    '([a . 12]         '([a   . 12]
      [bar . 23])        [bar . 23])

    (cond [a? #t]      (cond [a?   #t]
          [b? (f x           [b?   (f x
                 y)]                  y)]
          [else #f])         [else #f])

Or with point on the `'` before `a`:

    (list 'a 12        (list 'a   12
          'bar 23)           'bar 23)

If more than one couple is on the same line, none are aligned,
because it is unclear where the value column should be. For
example the following form will not change; `racket-align' will
display an error message:

    (let ([a 0][b 1]
          [c 2])       error; unchanged
      ....)

When a couple's sexprs start on different lines, that couple is
ignored. Other, single-line couples in the series are aligned as
usual. For example:

    (let ([foo         (let ([foo
           0]                 0]
          [bar 1]            [bar 1]
          [x 2])             [x   2])
      ....)              ....)
