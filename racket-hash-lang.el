(defvar racket-hash-lang-module-language-hook nil
  "Hook run when the module language changes.

The hook is called when a file is first visited, and thereafter
whenever the \"#lang\" line is edited -- provided that results in
new language info; for example changing from \"#lang racket\" to
\"#lang racket/base\" will /not/ run the hook.

The function is called with a string returned by the lang's
\"module-language\" info key. This info key is supplied
automatically when a language is defined using
syntax/module-reader:

  <https://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax/reader-helpers.html#%28mod-path._syntax%2Fmodule-reader%29>.

Otherwise a lang might not supply this and the value will be nil.

The hook is useful when you want to vary Emacs behavior in ways
that go beyond what a lang can describe. This may include
enabling \"fancy\" or \"classic\" Emacs behaviors only for
s-expression langs.

For example, maybe you want to use `paredit-mode' when it is
suitable for the module language, otherwise stick with the
plainer `electric-pair-mode'.

  "Use color-lexer, indent, and navigation supplied by a #lang.

An experimental major mode alternative to `racket-mode' for
source file edit buffers.

In your Emacs configuration, you may want to update the
variable `auto-mode-alist' to use `racket-hash-lang-mode' for
file extensions like \".rkt\", \".scrbl\", and/or \".rhm\".

See also the customization variable
`racket-hash-lang-token-face-alist' and the hook variable
`racket-hash-lang-module-language-hook'.

A discussion of the information provided by a Racket language:

  <https://docs.racket-lang.org/tools/lang-languages-customization.html>

Note that langs supply colors only for lexer tokens like strings
and comments. If you enable the minor mode `racket-xp-mode', it
can contribute more colors; see the customization variable
`racket-xp-binding-font-lock-face-modes'.
