# Racket mode for GNU Emacs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/greghendershott/racket-mode.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/greghendershott/racket-mode)
[![MELPA](http://melpa.org/packages/racket-mode-badge.svg)](http://melpa.org/#/racket-mode)

This provides a major mode to edit [Racket] source files, as well as a
major mode for a Racket REPL. The edit/run experience is similar to
[DrRacket].

- Focus on Racket.
  - Mode line and menu say `Racket`.
  - Omit stuff for various current and historical Schemes that's not
    applicable to Racket.

- Use [DrRacket] concepts where applicable.
  - A simple and obvious way to "run" a file.
  - Allow interaction in the REPL, but the effect is wiped on the next
    run.
  - A simple way to run unit tests (to run the `test` submodule).

- More thorough syntax highlighting ("font-lock"):
  - All Racket keywords, built-ins, self-evals, and so on.
  - All variations of `define` for functions and variables.

- Correct indentation of Racket forms, including `for/fold` and
  `for*/fold`.

- Compatible with **Emacs 24.3+** and **Racket 6.0+**.

- [More](Reference.md).

## Caveats

- If you've used other Lisps and Schemes before, you might prefer
  [Geiser], which is very sophisticated.

- Although I dogfood this -- use it constantly to code Racket -- it is
  beta quality. My total experience writing Emacs modes consists of
  writing this mode.

- Pull requests from smarter/wiser people are welcome.

- Please report issues [here][issue], including the output from `M-x
  racket-bug-report`.

## Install

The recommended way to use `racket-mode` is to install the package
from [MELPA]. <kbd>M-x package-install</kbd>, `racket-mode`.

[MELPA]: http://melpa.org/

> **TIP**: To use MELPA add the following to your `~/.emacs` or
> `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:
>
> ```
> (require 'package)
> (add-to-list 'package-archives
>              '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/")
>              t)
> ```

### Minimal Racket

If you have installed the minimal Racket distribution (for example by
using the [homebrew recipe]): `racket-mode` needs some additional
packages (like `errortrace` and `macro-debugger`). A simple way to get
all these packages is to install the `drracket` package:

```shell
$ raco pkg install drracket
```

[homebrew recipe]: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/racket.rb

## Update

Be aware that Emacs package updates don't necessarily fully update
Emacs' state. An example symptom is an "invalid function" error
message. You might need to restart Emacs. In some cases, you might
even need to:

1. Uninstall racket-mode
2. Exit and restart Emacs
3. Install racket-mode

If you still experience a problem, please `M-x racket-bug-report` and
submit an [issue].

## Configure

To start, there are only two [variables](Reference.md#variables) you
_might_ need to set:

- `racket-racket-program` is the name or pathname of the Racket
  executable. This defaults to `Racket.exe` on Windows else `racket`.

- `racket-raco-program` is the name or pathname of the Raco
  executable. This defaults to `Raco.exe` on Windows else `raco`.

On Windows or Linux, these defaults will probably work for you.

On OS X, downloading Racket doesn't add its `bin` directory to your
`PATH`. Even after you add it, GUI Emacs doesn't automatically use
your path (unless you use the handy [exec-path-from-shell] package).
Therefore you may want to set both of these to be full pathames like
`/usr/racket/bin/racket` and `/usr/racket/bin/raco`.

[exec-path-from-shell]: http://melpa.org/#/exec-path-from-shell

You can `setq` these directly in your Emacs init file (`~/.emacs` or
`~/.emacs.d/init.el`), or, use <kbd>M-x Customize</kbd>, as you
prefer.

If you have installed racket via [hombrew](http://brewformulas.org/PltRacket) 
you will need to install additional packages with [raco](http://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/index.html):
```shell
 $ raco pkg install drracket
```

### Key bindings

To customize things like key bindings, you can use `racket-mode-hook`
in your Emacs init file. For example, although <kbd>F5</kbd> and
<kbd>C-c C-k</kbd> are bound to the `racket-run` command, let's say
you wanted <kbd>C-c r</kbd> to be an additional binding:

```cl
(add-hook 'racket-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (define-key racket-mode-map (kbd "C-c r") 'racket-run)))
```

### Unicode input method

An optional Emacs input method, `racket-unicode`, lets you easily type
various Unicode symbols that might be useful when writing Racket code.

To automatically enable the `racket-unicode` input method in
`racket-mode` and `racket-repl-mode` buffers, put the following code
in your Emacs init file:

```cl
(add-hook 'racket-mode-hook      #'racket-unicode-input-method-enable)
(add-hook 'racket-repl-mode-hook #'racket-unicode-input-method-enable)
```

For more information, see the documentation: <kbd>C-h f
racket-unicode-input-method-enable</kbd>.

### Completion

The usual `M-x complete-symbol` -- bound by default to
<kbd>C-M-i</kbd> -- works, drawing on all symbols in the current
Racket namespace.

> Tip: When you first visit a .rkt file, or edit it to change its
> `require`s, you may need to `racket-run` it to make the symbols
> available. Otherwise, you may get "stale" symbols, or just those
> from `racket/base`.

To have <kbd>TAB</kbd> do completion as well as indent, add the
following to your Emacs init file:

```cl
(setq tab-always-indent 'complete)
```

This changes the behavior of Emacs' standard `indent-for-tab-command`,
to which <kbd>TAB</kbd> is bound by default in the racket-mode edit
and REPL modes.

### Font-lock (syntax highlighting)

Font-lock (as Emacs calls syntax highlighting) can be controlled using
`font-lock-maximum-decoration`, which defaults to `t` (maximum). You
can set it to a number, where 0 is the lowest level. You can even
supply an association list to specify different values for different
major modes.

Historically you might choose a lower level for speed. These days you
might do so because you prefer a simpler appearance.

Racket-mode supports four, increasing levels of font-lock:

0: Just strings, comments, and `#lang`.

1: `#:keyword`s and self-evaluating literals like numbers, `'symbol`s,
   `'|symbols with spaces|`, regular expressions.

2: Identifiers in `define`-like and `let`-like forms.

3: Identifiers provided by `racket`, `typed/racket`, `racket/syntax`,
   and `syntax/parse`. (This level effectively treats Racket as a
   language, instead of a language for making languages.)

### paredit

You may want to add keybindings to `paredit-mode-map`:

- Bind <kbd>{</kbd> and <kbd>}</kbd> to `paredit-open-curly` and
  `paredit-close-curly`, respectively.

- Bind whatever keys you prefer for `paredit-wrap-square` and
  `paredit-wrap-curly`.

### smartparens

To use the default configuration that smartparens provides for Lisp
modes generally and for racket-mode specifically, add to your Emacs
init file:

```
(require 'smartparens-config)
```

### eldoc

By default racket-mode sets `eldoc-documentation-function` to `nil` --
no `eldoc-mode` support. You may set it to `racket-eldoc-function` in
a `racket-mode-hook` if you really want to use `eldoc-mode` with
Racket. But it is not a very satisfying experience because Racket is
not a very "eldoc-friendly" language. Although racket-mode attempts
to discover argument lists, contracts, or types this doesn't work in
many common cases:

- Many Racket functions are defined in `#%kernel`. There's no easy way
  to determine their argument lists. Most are not `provide`d with a
  contract.

- Many of the interesting Racket forms are syntax (macros) not
  functions. There's no easy way to determine their "argument
  lists".

A more satisfying experience is to use `racket-describe` or
`racket-doc`.

## Documentation

Within Emacs, use the usual help functions.

- Type <kbd>C-h m</kbd> to get help about the modes in effect for the
  current buffer, including a list of key bindings and commands.

- To see help about a specific command, for example `racket-run`, type
  <kbd>C-h f</kbd> and then <kbd>racket-run</kbd>.

Here on GitHub you can browse the [Reference](Reference.md).

## Background/Motivation

I started this project accidentally, while trying to figure out a
font-lock issue with [Quack] under Emacs 24.2.

[Quack]: http://www.neilvandyke.org/quack/

Knowing nothing about how to make a mode in Emacs, I tried to isolate
the problem by making a simple major mode, then adding things until it
broke. It didn't break and I ended up with this.

I took various `.emacs.d` hacks that I'd previously made to use with
Quack, and rolled them into this mode.

Also, I'd recently spent time adding Racket fontification to the
Pygments project, and wanted richer font-lock.

Also, I had experienced issues with `enter!` not always reloading
modules in recent versions of Racket, and came up with a DrRacket-like
alternative, `run!`.

Finally, I remembered that when I was new to Racket and Emacs, I got
confused by the _Scheme_ menu. It has options that work with various
Schemes over the years, but which are N/A for Racket. I would stare it
and wonder, "Um, how do I just 'run my program'??". I figured a fresh
focus on Racket might be helpful, especially for other folks
transitioning from using DrRacket.

Update, Jan 2014: After I had used this for a long time, putting up
with its quirks, someone put it on MELPA. That nudged me to take
another look, learn more about Elisp and Emacs modes, and improve
it. Although I still feel like an amateur, it has probably improved
from alpha to beta quality.
